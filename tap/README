This is a very early cut at a "send stuff to paging services" program.

It can send messages to paging providers using the IXO/TAP protocol
(e.g. E+ and D1 in Germany) or the UCP protocol (D2 in Germany).

No useful documentation is available right now :-)

UPDATE (2005): the SMS centers seem to be all broken nowadays, so your
               best bet to send out SMSs is to get a mobile phone and
               an RS232 data cable - then use "atsms".
