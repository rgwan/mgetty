Hi all,

this is a new experimental vgetty release. I tried to integrate vgetty and
mgetty parts more closely. Since this included some modifications to some
vgetty low level parts, quite a few things and drivers might be broken in
this release. But I'm sure, it will be easy to fix them soon.

As always this is yet another vgetty test release. I incorporated many
changes and I probably forgot some of the patches, that you mail me. Please
feel free to resubmit them. If you plan to submit buxfixes or changes to me,
please keep in mind: I only accept a unified diff against the latest
released mgetty/vgetty version. Everything else is more work for me and I
don't have the time for that. You can produce a unified diff by first
copying the original unchanged file to something like file.c.orig and then
use the command "diff -u file.c.orig file.c > patch_for_marc". Thanks a lot!

Please have a look at the voice/ToDo file. If there is something missing,
that you would like to see, please let me know, I probably add it to the
ToDo list. If there is something you want to do, please get in contact with
me first, to avoid, that two people are working on the same problem.

Also if you did something for vgetty and I didn't put you in the voice/Credits
file, please mail me! I don't want to forget someone, but I probably did
already.

Now the good things:

* Tighter integration of mgetty and vgetty low level parts.

* Some USR modems produced gsm data, that were not accepted by the gsm
  library.

* Changed the base unit for the beep command to milliseconds.

* Quite a lot other minor changes, I forgot...

The new release is included in the latest mgetty-beta on ftp.leo.org as
always.

Enjoy,
Marc
