Hi all,

this is a new vgetty beta release. Judging from the reports on the mailing
list, this release should be quite stable and reliable. Feedback is, as
always, very welcome. There are no great new features, but a lot of bug
fixes and small enhancements.

If you plan to submit buxfixes or changes to me, please keep in mind: I only
accept a unified diff against the latest released mgetty/vgetty version.
Everything else is more work for me and I don't have the time for that. You
can produce a unified diff by first copying the original unchanged file to
something like file.c.orig and then use the command "diff -u file.c.orig
file.c > patch_for_marc". Thanks a lot!

Please have a look at the voice/ToDo file. If there is something missing,
that you would like to see, please let me know, I probably add it to the
ToDo list. If there is something you want to do, please get in contact with
me first, to avoid, that two people are working on the same problem.

Also if you did something for vgetty and I didn't put you in the voice/Credits
file, please mail me! I don't want to forget someone, but I probably did
already.

The new release is included in the latest mgetty-beta on ftp.leo.org as
always.

Enjoy,
Marc
