Hi Rick,

Marc Schaefer is now responsible for the vgetty project, so I forward
your mail to him. If the Zoom modem is IS-101 compatible, it should
be pretty trivial to get it to work. Basically copy the Dr_Neuhaus.c
file to something like Lucent.c and add the neccessary codes to the
table in detect.c. In this case ATI -> ERROR should induce another
question with ATI0 -> ZOOM*. I wouldn't map ERROR to lucent.c, even
it is right now unique, because there might be some really broken
modem with the same answer. So the two lines for detect.c are:

     {ati, "ERROR", "ATI0", NULL},
     {ati6, "ZOOM*", NULL, &Lucent},

[ schaefer 09/10/99: really ati0 instead of "ATI0" and ati6. This is
                     now in code ]

Bye,
Marc
