  4) Option to read and analyse the raw caller ID data from the modem.

  6) Run the vgetty scripts under a specified user-/group-id

  9) Update the documentation.

 24) Make vgetty stay in voice mode all the time from initialization on
     to prevent dialout, if the local phone if off-hook (can only be
     detected in voice mode)

 32) Add a new option to wait between answering the phone and playing
     of the greeting message to allow some modems to detect fax calls
     more reliable.

 36) Add comments to the pvf header (analogous to the pbm tools).

 37) New RMD2 format, that includes timing marks and <DLE> shielding.

 38) Option to send received voice data to a file and to an audio device,
     so that it is possible to listen to incoming messages even without
     the modem speaker.

 39) New bi-directional mode for voice operation to allow full duplex
     voice mode. This is possible with ISDN cards and maybe with some
     modems. Probably requires huge changes to the sources.
