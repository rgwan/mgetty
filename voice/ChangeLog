Sat Nov 13 10:31:37 MET 1999   Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Released mgetty-1.1.21-to-current-13111999
	
	Those two changes absolutely need wide testing:
	
	* Removed the enter_fax_mode() function from libvoice/mode.c,
	and moved the enter_data_fax_mode() from vgetty/answer.c to
	libvoice/mode.c. This ensures that there is only one way to
	answer and go data or fax from voice mode. Before, we had two,
	each one with its own set of bugs. This changes the way answering
	is done, also the going to fax/data when a voice shell fails,
	but also GET_FAX and SEND_FAX voice shell commands.

	* Patched the resulting libvoice/mode.c with the recently posted
	patch (from Dmitri Pogosyan), which should fix the Rockwell
	problem when going from voice to fax/data. The idea being that
	you use auto-detection ONLY if answer_mode is ANSWER_DATA|ANSWER_FAX.
	Else, if it's only one of the two, you switch off modem
	autodetection (+FAA=0) so that +FCLASS state is used.

	Those changes are presumably minor:

	* Patched libvoice/detect.c to support the Italian version of the
	Rockwell modem (Rockwell compatible modem 33600), submitted
	by <Free Ekanayaka> ekafree@freemail.it.

	* Added setup information for PowerBit modems to
	contrib/PowerBit_Olsson, submitted by Håkan Olsson,
 	<suntron@algonet.se>
	
Sat Oct  9 15:01:32 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added contrib/Raoul_Boenisch about some Dr. Neuhaus speed-related
 	problems and fixes.

	* Added doc/NOTE about where to find some documentation.

	* Modified libvoice/detect.c and libvoice/README.lucent for supporting
	some Lucent variant. jsrockford@my-Deja.com is presumably testing it.
	Also cleanuped detect.c (using variables). Note that Lucent is
        not implemented yet: read libvoice/README.lucent for guidelines
        if you have this modem's documentation.

	* libvoice/signal.c: added child pid in log file. Also, now
	capturing the exit status instead of ignoring it, and logging
	at WARN level if non zero. Suggested by Gert.

	* Added scripts/new_voice.craig_southern from
 	     http://www.southeren.com/craig/vgetty/

	* Added ability, in vm, to output to the EXTERNAL_SPEAKER (-e
	option). Patch submitted by baitisj@cyberdude.com.

Thu Sep 16 11:06:43 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added detection support for ZyXEL Omni 56k. Some issues
	still remaining, such as DTMF preference setting command.

	* Adding ability to use either the new AT+IFC or the old AT\Q3
	in Elsa, with dynamic adjustment in case of error. We now
	try AT+IFC first. Reported by Steffen Klupsch, and fix
	suggested by Gert. Simplified Elsa's internals. Reported to
	work (eschmann@stud.uni-frankfurt.de).
	
	* Fixed bug with libvoice/signal.c regarding child termination.
	The fix works on HPUX (says boban@zaslon.si), and maybe also
	fixes the Solaris coredump problems. At this time, this fix
	is untested on other plateforms, but presumably should do
	something nice anyway.

Wed Sep  8 16:10:46 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed bug with libvoice/US_Robotics.c: wrong command
	introduced in 1.1.21 (ringback). Would cause the modem
 	[Sportster Voice 33.6] to report an error and stop responding
 	to any further commands. Fix by <alborchers@steinerpoint.com>

	* Added comment of John Lowry <jlowry@netcom.com> about fixing
	some problems with dial out and NO_DIAL_TONE with vm in
	voice/contrib/John_Lowry.
	
Sat Aug 21 14:12:09 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed perl module Perl/Vgetty.pm (undefined reference).

	* Work-around for ATH0 in Rockwell_set_device() breakimg
	  the RC32ACL (zukerman@math-hat.com).

	* Added a few problems to fix to Todo, some being fixed, some not.

Wed Aug 11 22:57:55 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Had a nice eclipse :)

	* Fixed libvoice/UMC.c's use of C++ style comment (one define
	commented with ANSI C). This shows up e.g. with plain ANSI
	C compilers, or old versions of gcc.

	* Changed version to 0.9.6 / 11Aug99 so to make it a little
	different.

Sat Jul 24 14:26:46 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* gert released 1.1.21
	
	* doc/Readme.voice_shell: updated with the new commands.
	
Tue Jul 20 08:49:10 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Timeouts for ringback: if no ringback is detected within the timeout
	time, the modem assumes the other side answered the phone (was
	needed for outgoing dial). Note that not all modems support these
	commands (+VRA/+VRN). Notably the Multitechs don't. This adds new
	configuration options: ``ringback_goes_away'' and
	``CONF(ringback_never_came, 100, CT_INT)'', see include/default.h
	and voice.conf-dist.
 	
	* The US Robotics modem forgets its voice setting when it leaves voice
 	mode: a special function voice_mode_on() was created.
 	
	* Sending a beep to US Robotics turns the speaker on, we shut it
 	down (best way would be to keep it how it was).
 	
	* Added ``GET MODEM'' voice shell interface command to get the
 	underlying modem hardware type (e.g. for sending the right RMD file
 	type).
 	
	* Added a new ``linger'' optional argument to the play command. When
 	given, it will make the multi-DTMF detection more reliable when used
 	with ``AUTOSTOP'': with some modems, or with some configurations, it
 	seems that between the time ``PLAY'' and ``WAIT'' are issued you can
 	loose key-presses, especially with US Robotics modems.

	* All the above for Jul 20 was submitted by Al BORCHERS,
	<alborchers@steinerpoint.com>

Sun Jul 18 19:31:49 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Incremental bug fix for US_Robotics.c submitted by
	"Luca Olivetti" <luca@olivetti.dhis.org> for the external or
	internal speaker beep conflicting with line work-around.
	
	* Added EXTERNAL_SPEAKER support in shell.c, contributed
	by "Luca Olivetti" <luca@olivetti.dhis.org>.

	* Added some files in contrib/
	
Sun Jul  4 09:13:10 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed libutil/access.c to set EGID before EUID so that it is
	possible.
	
Sun Jun 27 12:16:20 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* The owner, groups and mode were only set after the file
 	recording was complete. Moreover, the file was created without any
 	correct security checks. Now, we switch the EUID/EGID/umask of the
 	process when opening the file. That should fix the specific user
 	request (not having files root.root 644 when recording), and also
 	fix more serious security problems. Additionnally, we now do the
 	same when playing a file. This is done through a new set of
	functions in libutil/access.c. Problem reported by
	uzs7ph@uni-bonn.de.

	* Calling the new function setup_environment() from
	vgetty/answer.c's vgetty_answer function. This renders *some*
	of the called-ID specific patch obsolete, and it was slightly
	rewritten for that purpose. This was suggested by gert.

	* Added new set_device mode definitions (suggestion by
	Steffen Klupsch <steffen@vlsi.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>, see
	also voice/contrib/Steffen_Klupsch-new-set-device-modes).

Tue Jun 15 14:28:20 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added a modem quirk field in the include/hardware.h modem structure.
	Defined VMQ_NEEDS_SET_DEVICE_BEFORE_ANSWER to reverse, if set, the
 	order of answering/setting line for the modems which are broken in
 	that aspect. This field is set to zero for all modems, except
	UMC. Reported by steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de.

	* Fixed bug with Compaq_VS.c which had the recently added
	play_dtmf missing (should have seen that in compilation, hey ?).

	* Added an unconditionnal ``go to voice mode'' in libvoice/UMC.c,
	this fixes the ``modem doesn't know in which state he is'' bug
	reported & fixed by steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de.

	* Modified vgetty/answer.c to support the above modem quirk bit.

	* libvoice/UMC.c: fixed the 'beep' command, the UMC_VTS_WORKAROUND
 	produced a horrible and loud scream, the modem command at#vts
 	sounds better :-) (steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de).

	* libvoice/UMC.c: setting default compression to 4 bit ADPCM,
 	because only this is supported by the pvftools.

	* Changed the faxmode command from 'AT+FCLASS=' to 'AT#CLS='
	-- this is said to be better regarding call discrimination.
 	(At least for UMC modems.)

	* voice/pvftools/pvftormd.c and voice/pvftools/rmdtopvf.c:
	added support for UMC's 4 Bit ADPCM.
	
Sat May 15 21:53:52 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added information/patch for old 5.x 1496 ZyXEL. As those
	problems are no longer found with the current 6.x ROM version
	(such as 6.19), I just include the information/patch as-is
	in voice/contrib/Wolfram_Gloger
	
	* Added script example to make MultiTech 2834ZDXv dial out and
	play voice message to voice/contrib/Mark_Haun

	* RING_DETECTED is now supported as an event in WAITING (event.c)

	* Added temporary Smarty/Neuhaus detection. This could break
 	Rockwell modems. In case it does, change the #if 0 at line
	63 to #if 1 and report this to me (detect.c). Contributed by
	Raoul.Boenisch@uni-essen.de.

	* Enabled support for the INTERNAL_MICROPHONE for Dr_Neuhaus.c
	(for the Smarty; contributed by Raoul.Boenisch@uni-essen.de)

	* Fixed Multitech_2834.c: would not go correctly to
	DIALUP_LINE (but to LOCAL_HANDSET instead). Submitted
	by alborchers@steinerpoint.com. Same fix reported
	to the other instances (5634, but NOT 5600ZDXv since
	already fixed it seems).

	* Fixed Multitech_2834.c: sometimes the fixup echo
	workaround wouldn't work with some firmwares. Made it so
	the fix is inactive if echo is disabled. Reported this
	fix to  the other instances (5634, but NOT 5600ZDXv since
	already fixed it seems).
	Submitted by alborchers@steinerpoint.com

	* US_Robotics.c:
	     - added URL for technical documentation
	     - patch by gmilner@my-dejanews.com for local handset support
	     - patch by Niels@Basjes.nl to ignore DIAL TONE when
	       recording or playing (bug work-around).

	* Updated ToDo files

	* Updated the FAQ. Warning, this might not be in sequence with
	  the official FAQ. This has to be worked-around some time now.
	
Tue Mar 16 11:02:26 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed so that when PNP detection fails (ATI9) we correctly
	revert to ATI, eating output when needed. This was reported by
	Al Borchers alborchers@steinerpoint.com. This should fix
	many problems encountered by people upgrading to 1.1.20
	plus the 10021999 global patch.
