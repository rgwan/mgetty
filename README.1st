Hi,

this is the mgetty+sendfax distribution. It contains programs to send
and receive faxes in a unix environment using a class 2 faxmodem.

For detailed informations how everything works and how to build and use
it, see the file "mgetty.texi" (in doc/, see below)

If you can access the WWW, you might try looking at
http://www.leo.org/~doering/mgetty/index.html, you'll find all the
documentation and the FAQ nicely formatted there.


My license policy boils down to this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mgetty+sendfax package is Copyright (c) 1993 Gert Doering. You are
permitted to do nearly anything you want with this program - redistribute
it, use parts of the code in your own programs, ..., but you have to give
me credit - do not remove my name.

If you make money by selling mgetty, I want a share.

For more details, see the chapter "copying conditions" in mgetty.texi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


To make the programs, copy "policy.h-dist" to "policy.h", edit it according
to your needs. Then edit "Makefile" to set CC=, CCFLAGS= and the various
xxxDIR= (LIB/MAN/BIN/SBINDIR) to fit your system. After that, running "make" 
should do. "Make" will also create the "mgetty.texi"-File in "doc/". 

If you upgrade from a previous version, it may be a good idea to make
a "diff" from the original policy.h-dist and the policy.h used later, and
use that as a base for configuring policy.h of this release.

Most of the options set in "policy.h" can be changed at run-time from the
"mgetty.config" configuration file. Policy.h controls where it should be.

With C-Compilers that do not understand the "#ident" directive, give the
"make noident" command before using the "make" command for the first
time.

Run "make testdisk" to see if the disk statistics grabber works (it should
report the correct block free count for the partitions containing "/" and
".".  If not, consult getdisk.c, taking special note of the "v*" defines
for hints as to which settings you use.  If your system is one of the "v*",
try defining that "v*" macro in the Makefile CCFLAGS.  Please let us know
what works, and what your C compiler uses to identify your computer.

Finally, "make install".


If you have any problems, suggestions or bug reports, please contact 
gert@greenie.muc.de or gert@space.net (greenie preferred!) - but make 
sure you have read the documentation first! I get quite annoyed when 
I have to answer the same questions for the 99th time! Read "BUGS"!

And... please do not forget that I'm doing this kind of support entirely
in my spare time - sometimes my answers will be very short, or it may
take a long time for me to answer - since sometimes I need my time to
make a living...

Now... have fun & fax!
