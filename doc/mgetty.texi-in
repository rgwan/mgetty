@chapter Introduction

@code{mgetty} allows you to make optimum use of your modem or fax modem in
a unix environment. @code{mgetty} handles incoming calls without
interfering with outgoing calls. If the modem can do fax class 2 or 2.0,
@code{mgetty} can also receive faxes.

@code{sendfax} is a standalone backend program to send fax files.  

This manual explains how to configure and install the package on various
operating systems and modems, and how to use those programs.

@node Overview, Supported, Copying, Intro
@section Features of @code{mgetty} and @code{sendfax}

This package contains two major programs, @code{mgetty} and
@code{sendfax}.

This is what you can do with @code{sendfax} if you have a standard
class 2 fax modem:

@itemize @bullet
@item
send faxes directly or using shell scripts

@item
do ``fax polling'', this means you can call the weather station and
get them to send you a fax containing the current weather map. (Not all
modem manufacturers implement this feature in their modems!)

@item
create a ``fax queue'', outgoing faxes get sent automatically, the
user is informed by mail about the result.
@end itemize

@code{mgetty} allows you to use a single modem line for receiving
calls and dialing out.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{mgetty} knows about ``smart'' modems, and will make sure that the
modem is always in a defined state (specific modem initialization possible)

@item
Incoming calls are answered manually (@code{RING}
-> @code{ATA} -> @code{CONNECT}) instead of using auto-answer
(@samp{ATS0=1}), this way the modem won't pick up the phone when the
machine is down or logins are not allowed. 

@item
@code{mgetty} incorporates all features of uugetty: it honours @file{LCK.*}
files created by @code{uucico} and other comm programs, this way it will
prevent dial-outs while a caller is online and it won't be confused if
other programs use the modem.

@item
@code{mgetty} can receive faxes (if your modem supports fax class 2 or 2.0).

@item
@code{mgetty} knows about incoming FidoNet calls.

@item
@code{mgetty} has extensive logging / debugging features

@item
do ``fax poll sending'', that is, you can setup your machine as fax poll
server, to send some fax pages to ``fax poll'' callers. (Send informations
about your system, the current wheather map, ...). Be warned, even less
modems support this feature.

@item
@code{mgetty} can selectively refuse calls based upon CallerID, if your
modem supports it, and you're subscribed to the service.
CallerID is also logged.

@item
@code{mgetty} has facilities to allow you to refuse incoming FAXes when
available disk space is low.

@end itemize

@node Supported, Install, Overview, Intro
@section Supported systems and modems

Mgetty has been successfully installed and run on the following
systems:

@display
    SCO Unix 3.2.1 (ODT 1.0)                (well tested)
    SCO Unix 3.2.4 (ODT 2.0 + 3.0)         (very well tested)
    Linux 0.99pl1 .. 1.1pl88                  (very well tested)

    SVR4.2 Unix                                 (needs more testing)
    AT&T 3B1 3.51m                             (well tested)
    HP-UX 8.x and 9.x                          (well tested)
    AIX                                           (well tested)
    SunOS                                        (well tested)
    Solaris 2.x                                (well tested)  
    NetBSD / FreeBSD                         (well tested)
@end display

It should be possible to run mgetty on any other Unix with @file{termio.h}
or @file{termios.h}. For best results, use of the library functions
@code{select(S)} or @code{poll(S)} is recommended, but there's a workaround
if your system hasn't either. (Warning: for Unix SVR3.1 or earlier,
@emph{do not use poll()}, it will not
work on tty devices.)


Up to now, it has been successfully used with the following modems (no
exhaustive list) in fax mode:

@display
    ZyXEL U1496 (various ROM releases)
        (very well tested, a couple of problems remain, depending on the
         ROM release)

    MultiTech (various models)
        (tested, works very well, very good fax implementation)

    SupraFAX v32bis
        (tested, works well, no fax polling available)

    GVC FM144/+
        (tested, works well, no fax polling available)

    TKR DM-24VF+ (Deltafax)
        (tested, works quite well)

    Zoom V.FAST 24K/28K
        (tested, works, some problems with fax/data distinction)

@end display

It @emph{should} work with all class 2 faxmodems. Maybe the DC2
character sent at the beginning of a page by @file{faxrec.c} must be
changed to XON, for old class 2 modems (implementing very old drafts of
the standard). @xref{Modems}. 

In Data mode, it will work with every Hayes-compatible modem.


@node Install, intro-runtime, Supported, Intro
@section Configuration and installation

Compiling of the package should be quite straightforward. You have to
copy @file{policy.h-dist} to @file{policy.h} and edit it to set some
local policy options, see the comments in that file.

Then, edit the @file{Makefile}, to specify installation paths, some
system defines and some system dependent libraries (explained there).

After that, a @samp{make} should build the programs, and @samp{make
install} should install them.
  
If your compiler complains about the @code{#ident} lines I use for
@file{SCCS}, please run @code{make noident}, that will take care of those
lines.

If you get an error message about ``unresolved symbols'' when linking, you
may have to tell the package whether you have the select(S) or poll(S)
system calls, by defining @code{-DUSE_SELECT} or @code{-DUSE_POLL} flags in
the @file{Makefile} (If you don't know it, try both, until the error goes
away). If it's not related to @code{select} or @code{poll}, please check
the systems man pages which libraries to link, and add appropriate
@code{-l<library>} statements to @code{LDFLAGS}.

If your system has neither the select(S) call nor the poll(S) call,
mgetty is not fully operational---these functions are the only way to
prevent mgetty from eating up characters when some other process is
trying to dial out.

You can use mgetty anyway, by specifying @code{-DUSE_READ} in the
Makefile, but beware: with this, mgetty will eat up at least one
character of the modem response when another program is dialing out.
That may lead to disastrous results if e.g. the @samp{CONNECT} string
is thus corrupted, but most of the time, the character that @file{mgetty}
eats away will be an @code{cr} or @code{nl} or part of the command
that the modem echoes back.

If you have any problems compiling mgetty and sendfax (on a Unix-like
system---I do not support MS-DOS or Windows!), please contact me.
@emph{But make sure that you have read the documentation!}

@node intro-runtime,  , Install, Intro
@section Runtime configuration: Overview

If @code{mgetty} or @code{sendfax} are run "as is", they will use their
compiled-in defaults from @file{policy.h}.

If the configuration files @file{mgetty.config} (@xref{runtime-mgetty}) and
@file{sendfax.config} (@xref{runtime-sendfax}) exist (and are readable),
both programs will get their run-time configuration from there. Items not
specified there will still be taken from the compiled-in defaults. Command
line switches will always override those settings. The configuration files
are usually located in @file{@CONFDIR@/}.

If you specify command line arguments (see the mgetty(1) and sendfax(8) man
pages for details), this will override both compiled-in and config file
defaults.

@chapter Using @code{mgetty}

You can't simply call @code{mgetty} from a shell script (like @file{/etc/rc})
or interactively, because login is not possible unless mgetty is called
directly by the @code{init} process. The next sections explain how to do this.

@node How, Inittab, mgetty, mgetty
@section How @code{mgetty} works

To help you understand how mgetty works, here is an example of what
happens in various circumstances when you use it to control a modem
connected to a serial line, e.g. @file{/dev/tty2a}.

When the computer is booted, the operating system starts the @code{init}
process, which is responsible for making sure that gettys are running on
the appropiate i/o devices, e.g. virtual terminals, serial lines and
modems.  @code{init} reads its configuration file, @file{/etc/inittab} (on
System V), which tells it that the line @file{/dev/tty2a} should be
controlled by mgetty. It then creates an entry in @file{/etc/utmp}
(@code{login} needs this, that's why you can't log in if you try to start
mgetty by hand), and forks a new @code{mgetty} process, using the command
line specified.

When mgetty is started, it first checks if a valid lock file held by
another process exists. If it does, this means that the port is in
use, and mgetty will wait until the lock file goes away. Invalid lock
files, e.g. for nonexistent processes (``stale'' locks), are ignored.

Once the port is free, mgetty creates its own lockfile, initializes the
modem and removes its lock file again. Then it waits for something to
happen on the port. Note that it does not @emph{read} any characters, it
just checks if there are any available for reading by using @code{poll()}
or @code{select()}.

There are two possibilities once characters arrive, either a different
program (e.g.  @code{uucico}) has started dialing out or a @samp{RING} was
sent by the modem.  In the first case, mgetty should leave the port
alone. This is easy @emph{if} the program dialing out has created a valid
lock file: mgetty will find it, wait for it to go away and then exit (which
will cause @code{init} to start a fresh @code{mgetty} process, which will
then wait for the next call).

In the second case, when there is no lock file, mgetty assumes that
the phone is ringing, creates a lock file and reads the characters
available. If it finds a @samp{RING}, it picks up the phone by sending
@samp{ATA} and waits for the @samp{CONNECT} message. If the caller is
a fax machine, it saves the fax in the directory @file{FAX_SPOOL_IN}
(usually @file{@FAX_SPOOL_IN@}) and exits. If it is a modem,
it prints @file{/etc/issue} and displays a login prompt. Once it has
received a login string, it calls @code{@LOGIN@} and lets it handle
things from here. @code{login} will read the password and will then
start the user's login shell, @code{uucico}, a dialup SLIP link or
whatever, but mgetty doesn't care about that. The lock file remains so
that no other programs will try to use the modem while somebody is logged in.

(If the @file{login.config} configuration file is used, mgetty can also call
other login programs than @code{@LOGIN@}. See below for more details)

Once mgetty has terminated for whatever reason, @code{init} might
reinitialize the port (this is why mgetty waits for lock files to go
away instead of quitting immediately) and will then start a new
@code{mgetty} process, which will remove lock files left over from the
last login.

The lock file handling is tricky, but very important. It is essential
that @emph{all} programs that use the modem agree on one locking
protocol, otherwise one program might not know that the modem is in
use and will try to dial out anyway. A typical lock file is a file
called @file{@LOCK@}, containing the process ID (PID) of
the process currently using the modem. Other processes can read it and
tell if the lock file belongs to an existing process or if it is
``stale'' and can be removed. This will obviously not work if the
processes look for lock files in different places, or if one of them
writes its PID in ASCII and another one tries to read it as a binary
number (while mgetty and sendfax do not care whether foreign lock files
are written in binary or ascii format, other programs do! mgetty can
sometimes detect this problem, and will then log a warning).

@node Inittab, Devices, How, mgetty
@section The @file{/etc/inittab} entry
An typical @file{inittab} entry for @code{mgetty} looks like this (on
SystemV-style OSes):

@example
<tt>:rlevel:<respawn|off>:@SBINDIR@/mgetty [options] <device>
@end example

where @samp{tt} is a short form of the @samp{device} name, used by
@code{init} and @code{who} for internal purposes. Usually this is
something like @samp{S0} or @samp{2A} or so.

@samp{rlevel} specifies the runlevel that the command in the fourth field
is run at, this may be @samp{23} or @samp{56} or so, look at @code{man
init} and the existing @file{/etc/inittab} on your system.

The next field tells @code{init} whether that entry is active
(@code{respawn}) or not (@code{off}), and the fourth field specifies the
full path of the program to run.

The following options are available for @code{mgetty}:

@samp{-x @var{<level>}} sets the debugging level. This is very important
for diagnosing problems, as with higher levels, @code{mgetty} will write
very detailed informations about its internal workings to its log file.

@samp{-s @var{<speed>}} sets the port speed. If not specified, the default
from @file{policy.h}, (definition @code{DEFAULT_PORTSPEED}) will be used.

@samp{-k @var{<space>}} sets the minimum number of kbytes required
on the incoming FAX spool directory.  If there isn't this much space
in the spool directory, the connection is terminated.  The default
is 1 megabyte.

@samp{-m @var{'expect send ...'}} sets the modem initialization sequence.
  
@samp{-r} for direct lines (no modem chats are done)

@samp{-p @var{<login prompt>}} sets the login prompt (various escapes are
allowed)

@samp{-n @var{<rings>}} sets the number of @code{RING} messages to expect
before sending @code{ATA} to answer the phone. Default is one @code{RING}.

@samp{-R @var{<sec>}} tells mgetty to enable ``ring-back'' or
``ring-twice'' mode. This means that mgetty won't pick up a call
immediately, but the caller has to hang up after the first ring, and
call again in the next @var{<sec>} seconds.

@samp{-i @file{/etc/issue}} specifies the issue file to display before 
prompting for login.

@samp{-S @file{<fax_document>}} specifies the document(s) to send to
polling fax machines (full path required). @file{<fax_document>} has to be
in G3 format (as for @code{sendfax}), or a text file listing G3 fax files
(one file per line).

A sample entry in @file{/etc/inittab} might look like this:

@example
F1a:23:respawn:@SBINDIR@/mgetty -x 3 tty2a
@end example

For a more detailed explanation of all the options, please look into the
@file{mgetty(1)} man page.

@node Devices, Logs, Inittab, mgetty
@section Choosing the right device

Some operating systems provide two separate devices for each serial
line, one of which is intended especially for gettys. This is
@emph{NOT} a good idea, because it won't work with @code{mgetty}. It is
meant for modems used in auto-answer mode.

@code{mgetty} picks up the phone by hand, this will only work properly
if you use the @emph{same} device you would use for dialing out. (Some
people like to create a symlink @file{/dev/modem} for this, but you
have to be consistent and use this for @emph{all} comm programs if you
do - otherwise you'll run into problems with the lock file names).

Here are some examples for different systems:

@itemize @bullet
@item
SV Unix systems using the FAS serial driver:

Use @code{ttyF01} etc., (minor number 80+(port number). Do @emph{not}
use @code{ttyFMxxx}---mgetty will open the device anyway, but then an
open to the ``normal'' port (without carrier detect) will block.

@item
SCO Unix systems with the stock serial driver:

Use the modem-control port (@code{tty2A}), @emph{not} @code{tty2a}, because
hardware flow control and carrier detection do not work on ``lowercase''
tty devices.

The same holds for ``smart'' serial boards, as specialix, digiboard,
@dots{}, because they mimic the behaviour of SCO's sio driver.

@item
Linux:

Use @file{/dev/ttyS*}, @emph{not} @file{/dev/cua*}. @xref{Linux}

@item
SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD:

Use @file{/dev/cua*}, not @file{/dev/ttyS*}. Don't ask me why it has to be
this way, but the other way won't work.

@end itemize

@node Logs, Deny, Devices, mgetty
@section Log files

@code{mgetty} will normally write all actions into a logfile, named
@file{LOG_PATH.@var{<device>}} (LOG_PATH is defined @file{policy.h}),
e.g. @file{@LOG_PATH@}, so you can easily see what's happening in your
system. (If a fatal error
occurs, the error message is also written to the console, and if that
is not possible, mailed to @samp{ADMIN}). The name of the log file can be
changed in @file{policy.h}.

If @code{mgetty} is compiled with @code{-DSYSLOG}, auditing and error log
messages will also go to @code{syslog} (if your system supports it).

@node Deny, Direct, Logs, mgetty
@section Denying logins

If you want to prevent mgetty from accepting calls, you can do so by
creating a file called @file{/etc/nologin.@var{<device>}}
(e.g. @file{/etc/nologin.tty2a}). If mgetty detects an incoming call, and
sees this file, it will @emph{NOT} answer the phone. This way the caller
does not lose money for a useless call when logins are not allowed
anyway. (You can change the filename that is checked by changing
@code{NOLOGIN_FILE} in @file{policy.h})

This can be used for quite sophisticated scheduling purposes - imagine a
modem attached to a line used for voice during the daytime. So, you want
the modem only to answer the phone during 9 pm and 7 am. What you do is to
have @code{cron} create a @file{/etc/nologin.@var{device}} file at 7 am (so
the modem won't answer the call during the day) and remove it at 9 pm (so
the modem can answer the phone at night).

Naturally, this can be easily extended - e.g., answer the phone only on
weekends (similar cron job), don't answer the phone if there are less
than 5 Mbyte free on disk (have a process check for free disk space
regularily and create @file{/etc/nologin.*} file(s) accordingly), @dots{}

@node Direct, Interaction, Deny, mgetty
@section Direct serial lines

If you have a direct serial line between two unix machines, or a unix
machine and something else, and want to run a getty program on the unix
side that should not interfere with outgoing traffic (e.g.: two unix
machines, both sides running gettys, both sides able to initiate an uucp
connection), you can also use mgetty. Start it with the @samp{-r} flag (as
with uugetty), and it will not try to initialize the modem or wait for
RINGs. It will just sit silently on the port and wait@dots{} You won't see
@file{/etc/issue} on the other side until mgetty gets at least one
character, this prevents two mgettys from talking to each other.

This may be valid for leased lines with modems in leased line mode as well,
but that may depend on your modem setup.

@node Interaction, Caller-ID, Direct, mgetty
@section Interaction between @code{mgetty} and other programs

Normally, after a caller enters his login name, @code{mgetty} calls
@code{@LOGIN@} to do the password checking and system login.

In some special cases, you may want to call other programs instead of
@code{@LOGIN@}. For example, you could want to call
@code{/usr/lib/uucp/uucico -L <username>} for all login names starting with
@samp{U*} (to have @code{uucico} do the authentication, works only with
taylor uucp 1.05 or taylor uucp 1.04 with my patch in
@file{patches/taylor.p1}), or @code{/usr/lib/fnet/ifcico} for incoming
FidoNet calls (using @code{ifcico} from Eugene Crosser's @file{ifmail}
package).

@code{mgetty} can do all this. It's controlled by a configuration file
@file{login.config}, normally located in
@file{@CONFDIR@/} (definition @code{LOGIN_CFG_FILE} in
@file{policy.h}). I have provided a sample file with lots of comments,
please look into that file for the syntax to use. To make @code{mgetty}
understand incoming fido calls, you have to compile it with @code{-DFIDO}.

If you are worrying about security, you can also use this mechanism: just
call @code{@LOGIN@} only for trusted, known users, and @code{/bin/false}
for every other login name - so, only those listed in @file{login.config}
will be able to log in.

@node Caller-ID, runtime-mgetty, Interaction, mgetty
@section Using Caller-ID to selectively accept or reject calls

Some telephone companies provide a service to the subscriber, called
``Caller ID'', where the phone number of the caller is transmitted while
your phone is ringing. Not all providers support it, and you'll have to
ask for it.

If your modem is able to retrieve callerid information, and @code{mgetty}
is compiled with @code{CNDFILE} defined in @file{policy.h}, @code{mgetty}
can check the caller's number before answering the phone. (Right now, I
know that it works for ZyXELs. I've implemented it for Rockwell, but didn't
get feedback yet. Volunteers?). If @code{CNDFILE} is undefined, or if that
file does not exist, all calls will be allowed.

Whether a call is accepted or denied is controlled by a configuration file,
set with @code{CNDFILE} in @file{policy.h}. Usual default is
@file{@CONFDIR@/dialin.config} (a sample file is installed per default).

That file contains a series of tokens separated by newlines, commas, tabs
and spaces. The callerid number is compared with each token in turn, until
a match occurs. A match occurs when the token compares equally to the
callerid information up to the length of the token.  If the token is
prefixed with a ``!'', a match means ``do not answer the phone''. The token
``any'' matches any telephone number, and will terminate scanning of the
cndfile. If no callerid number is present, it is assumed to have the value
``none''. A line starting with ``#'' is a comment.  There is an implicit
``any'' at the end of the file.
 
For example:

@example
	# list of my friends' data lines
	3433535, 7445343, 5551212
	# dad's fax
	4164646777
	# disallow [other] calls from numbers matching the following prefix:
	!416
	# disallow that speed dialer that keeps hitting my machine
	!3444444
	# allow all calls with the following prefixes
	832, 555
	# don't allow calls when there's no callerid:
	!none
	# It's okay to accept calls from out of area
	# ("OUT_OF_AREA" token seems ZyXEL specific)
	OUT_OF_AREA
	# disallow all other calls
	!any
@end example

For the future, Chris Lewis is planning on adding special modem initialization
strings (e.g., 2400 bps only, fax-only, ...) dependant on the caller
number.

@node runtime-mgetty,  , Caller-ID, mgetty
@section Runtime configuration for mgetty: @file{mgetty.config}

@code{Mgetty} works quite well with the compiled-in defaults (it has been
the only way to configure it for a long time), but that's quite unflexible,
and especially if you use different modem types, it's extremely unhandy.
The built-in defaults can be modified by command line options, but that's
not perfect either, because it makes @file{/etc/inittab} entries very long
and difficult to read.

If compiled with @emph{config file} support (define @code{MGETTY_CONFIG} in
@file{policy.h}), @code{mgetty} can use a configuration file, quite similar
to those which "Taylor UUCP" uses, which make dynamic setup far easier.

The config file is usually located in @file{@CONFDIR@/} and named
@file{mgetty.config}. Its format is very simple. Each line contains one
keyword, and possibly arguments for it, separated by whitespace. Empty
lines, and comment lines (lines starting with @samp{#}) are allowed.

The config file is grouped into port-specific sections, separated by
@code{port @var{<tty-name>}} lines. Everything before the first @code{port}
line specifies global defaults, everything between two @code{port}
statements specifies configuration items valid only for exactly this
device. Let me show you an example:

@example
# global defaults:
# fax station id is always the same
fax-id ++49-89-1234
# per port stuff
port tty1a
# This modem can't fax
modem-type data

port tty2a
# more verbose logging for this modem
debug 9
@end example


The data part of each line, following the keyword, can be a string (in most
cases), a chat sequence (a series of strings, separated by whitespace, that
specify the "modem talk" to do. It starts with "expect" string, then "send",
then "expect" again, and so on), an integer (interpreted as decimal, octal
or hexadecimal, depending on the leading character [1-9/0/0x]), or boolean
(@samp{y(es)} or @samp{t(rue)} vs. @samp{n(o)} or @samp{f(alse)}). If
no argument is specified, this will be considered ``value not set'' (if
allowed) or ``error'' (if value is mandatory), except for boolean values.
In that case, it's interpreted as @samp{true}.


Many of those configuration items can be overriden from the command line.
In that case, command line options take precedence over configuration file
settings (and those take precedence over built-in defaults). In many cases,
the built-in defaults can be set in @file{policy.h}.

The available configuration items are (command line options, if available,
given in brackets):

@itemize @minus
@item @code{speed} [-s] @var{port speed}

Specify, as integer value, the port speed to use. Default is
@code{DEFAULT_PORTSPEED}. If the given speed is not valid, @code{mgetty}
complains loudly and exits.

@item @code{switchbd} @var{fax recv. speed}

Some modems, mainly Rockwell chipsets, switch to 19200 bps when entering
fax mode. Others may need other speed switches (but I know none).  If your
modem is Rockwell based, try @code{switchbd 19200} if fax reception doesn't
work. (@strong{Warning:} if this is set wrongly, fax reception will
definitely fail. For most sane modems, you do @strong{not need} this.).
Default is @code{FAX_RECV_SWITCHBD}.

@item @code{direct} @var{yes/no} [-r]

Tells mgetty that it is running on a direct line. Mgetty won't try to
initialize any modem, nor will it wait for @samp{RING}. It will just wait
for any character, and then output the issue file and login prompt. This
option is used if you want to connect to machines via nullmodem cable.
Default is @var{no}, since @code{mgetty} is designed for modems@dots{}

@item @code{blocking} @var{yes/no} [-b]

Tells mgetty to open the device in @samp{blocking} mode, that is, the
@code{open()} system call won't succeed until carrier detect is set. This
is set if @code{mgetty} is called as @code{getty}. I'm not sure whether
it's very useful, but I include it for completeness. Default is @var{no}.

@item @code{port-owner} @var{username/userid}

If set, mgetty will @code{chown} the tty line to the given username (you
can specify a string or an integer uid, but the integer must be valid).
This is highly recommended for security purposes: only give port access to
those users you trust not to misuse your modem lines! Default is
@code{PORT_OWNER}.

@item @code{port-group} @var{groupname/gid}

If set, mgetty will @code{chgrp} the tty line to this group id (which can
be given as group name, or as integer gid). If it's not given, or not
valid, the primary group id of @samp{port-owner} will be used. Default is
@code{PORT_GROUP}.

@item @code{port-mode} @var{permissons}

Specifies the permissions to @code{chmod} the device to. @strong{Never}
make a modem device world-accessible, better use @samp{0660} or even
@samp{0600}. Default is @code{PORT_MODE}.

@item @code{toggle-dtr} @var{yes/no}

Tells mgetty whether it should lower the DTR line upon startup to reset
modem. Default is @samp{yes}, but some (few) modems react allergic to that
and crash.

@item @code{toggle-dtr-waittime} @var{msecs}

Specifies the time to hold the DTR line low. Default is 500 milliseconds.

@item @code{data-only} @var{yes/no} [-D]

Tells @code{mgetty} to forget about faxing and only use the data part of
the modem. Default is @samp{false}. You need this if your modem can't
distinguish incoming fax and data calls.

@item @code{fax-only} @var{yes/no} [-F]

Tells @code{mgetty} to put the modem in fax-only mode. You need this if
your modem can't distinguish incoming fax and data calls, but you need fax
more important than data; and you need it if you want to disable data calls
for security reasons (this could be achieved via @file{login.config} as well)

@item @code{modem-type} [-C] @var{mtype}

Specifies the kind of modem connected to the port. Default is
@code{DEFAULT_MODEMTYPE}. Valid options are:

@itemize @bullet
@item auto

Mgetty will detect the modem type itself (which may occasionally be not
desirable, or it may fail on old modem equipment).

@item c2.0

Modem is a @var{class 2.0} fax mode. Works better than class 2, if both are
available, because its better standardized. Known to work with USR and
ZyXEL.

@item cls2

Modem is a @var{class 2} fax modem, mgetty will not try class 2.0.

@item cls2ok

Modem is a @var{class 2} fax modem that does the bit order upon reception
@emph{right}. Most modems do it wrong (for compatibility with Rockwell, who
botched it in the first place), but some, for example MultiTech modems, do
it right, and it will make programs like @code{mgetty} fail. You'll see if
your modem falls into this category if decoding of incoming faxes with
@code{g3topbm} doesn't work, but @code{g3topbm @strong{-r}} does. This
won't affect the reliability of fax reception at all, it will only ease
decoding of the received pages. @strong{Not implemented yet}.

@item data

Do not try fax initialization, same as if @samp{-D} given.
@end itemize

There is no way (yet) to tell mgetty to use @strong{only} fax mode and
refuse data calls with this option, use the @code{fax-only true} statement
for that.

@item @code{init-chat} [-m] @var{expect send expect send ...}

Tells mgetty the chat sequence to use for initializing the modem.
@strong{Warning}: the sequence starts with @strong{expect}, which will in
most cases be @samp{""} (nothing). This ordering was chosen because UUCP
does it this way, and I wanted to avoid confusion here.

Example:

@example
init-chat "" \d\d\d+++\d\d\dATQ0E1V1H0 OK ATL0M0S0=0 OK AT&K3 OK
@end example

@item @code{modem-check-time} @var{seconds}

Some modems have the nasty tendency to crash silently. With this option,
you tell @code{mgetty} to check every @var{seconds} seconds with a simple
@samp{AT...OK} sequence whether the modem still reacts. If not,
@code{mgetty} will restart itself and do a full modem reset. Default is @code{MODEM_CHECK_TIME}

@item @code{rings} [-n] @var{nnn}

Sets the number of @code{RING} messages to wait for, before mgetty picks up
the phone. Default is 1. @strong{Warning:} if your modem auto-answers, for
whatever reason, set this to something @strong{different} than the value
set with @code{ATS0=mmm}, otherwise the modems autoanswer and mgettys
manual answer will collide (most modems hang up if a command is received
during auto-answer)

@item @code{get-cnd-chat} @var{chat sequence}

This is needed if you have a modem that supports ``caller ID'' detection,
but needs a special command to get the CID information. Right now, this is
only needed for some ELINK ISDN adaptors (@xref{Elink-ISDN}).

@item @code{answer-chat} @var{chat sequence}

This is the command sequence that is used to answer a phone call. Usually
you can leave it at the default @samp{ "" ATA CONNECT \c \r }, but for
some modems you need @samp{ATS0=1} in place of @samp{ATA} (ATA not
allowed). The extra @samp{\r} expect string is needed that the code can
grab the full @var{CONNECT xyz\r} string. It will work without the \r,
but then the logging information will be less detailed.

@item @code{answer-chat-timeout} @var{secs}

During the @var{answer-chat}, each "expect" string must be seen in the time
specified here. Default is 80 seconds. This time should be at least some 5
seconds longer than the time set with the @code{ATS7=...} modem setup
command.

@item @code{autobauding} @var{yes/no} [-a]

Some modems switch their DTE line speed to the communication line speed
after connecting, e.g., after sending @samp{CONNECT 2400}, the modem
switches to 2400 bps. Newer modems usually have a switch to "lock" a DTE
baud rate, which is strongly recommended. If your modem insists on doing
this speed switch, setting @code{autobauding} to @var{true} will make
mgetty behave accordingly.

@item @code{ringback} @var{yes/no} [-R]

If you have to put your modem and your telephone on the same phone line,
you can switch on "ringback" or "ring-twice". This means, mgetty won't
answer the phone on the first call, but remember the call, and pick up on
the second call (if it comes in the time specified by @code{ringback-time}).

@item @code{ringback-time} @var{secs}

This setting specifies how much time may pass between the first and the
second call if "ringback" is active. Default is 30 seconds.

@item @code{issue-file} [-i] @var{file}

This is the file printed before the login prompt. Default is
@samp{/etc/issue}.

@item @code{prompt-waittime} @var{msecs}

This specifies how long @code{mgetty} will wait for modem and line to
settle down before printing issue file and login prompt. Default is 500
milliseconds.

@item @code{login-prompt} [-p] @var{prompt}

This specifies the login prompt that mgetty will output. Some special
characters in this string (and in the issue file, btw) are recognized and
replaced by something else:

@itemize @bullet

@item @@ system name
@item \n newline
@item \r carriage return
@item \g bell
@item \b backspace (ascii 010)
@item \f form feed (ascii 013)
@item \t TAB
@item \P (and \L) port name (e.g. ttyS0)
@item \C date and time, in "ctime()" format
@item \I Connection string (e.g. 2400/REL)
@item \N (and \U) number of users currently logged in
@item \S Port speed (e.g. 38400)
@item \D current date in dd/mm/yy format
@item \T current time in hh:mm:ss format
@item \@var{digit} character with the specified octal code
@end itemize

The maximum lenght of the login prompt is limited to 140 characters (after
expansion).

@item @code{login-time} @var{secs}

This specifies the maximum time the user can take to log in. If no login
has occured after that time, @code{mgetty} will hang up. Default is
@code{MAX_LOGIN_TIME} from @file{policy.h}.

@strong{NOT implemented yet}

@item @code{fax-id} [-I] @var{local fax number}

This sets the fax station ID used in fax mode to identify your site to the
caller (usually this is simply your fax phone number). Default is
@code{FAX_STATION_ID}.

@item @code{fax-server-file} [-S] @var{poll control file}

Specifies the fax file(s) that is to be sent if someone else calls your
modem in @emph{fax polling mode}, that is, the caller @emph{receives} a
document.  

Normally, the file given is a text file, containing the list of G3 files to
send to the calling machine, one file per line. Comment lines (starting
with ``#'') are ignored. For backward compatibility, @code{mgetty} does
check whether the named file is a G3 file itself, in which case this file
is sent directly (but then, you can only send one page).

Not all modems support fax poll @emph{server} mode, I know that the ZyXEL
and MultiTech do.

@item @code{diskspace} [-k] @var{kbytes}

This setting tells mgetty the minimum amount of disk space that has to be
available in the fax spool directory for fax reception to be allowed.
Default is 1 Mbyte.

@item @code{notify} @var{mail address}

This is the address that will get mails if a fax is received. Not fully
tested.

@item @code{fax-owner} @var{username/uid}
@item @code{fax-group} @var{groupname/gid}
@item @code{fax-mode} @var{perms}

Similar to @code{port-owner/group/mode}, these settings specify the owner,
group and file mode mgetty will use for incoming faxes. Defaults are taken
from @code{FAX_IN_OWNER}, @code{FAX_IN_GROUP}, and
@code{FAX_FILE_MODE}.

@item @code{debug} [-x] @var{debug level}

This sets the amount of logging @code{mgetty} will do. A good value is
@var{4}, more details are seen with @code{5}, and @code{9} is really noisy.
Try it! The log data is written to the file specified by @code{LOG_PATH} in
@file{policy.h}, usually this is something like @file{@LOG_PATH@}.

@item @code{gettydefs} @var{gd tag}

If you use the gettdefs feature of @code{mgetty} -- which is @emph{not}
recommended! -- this specifies the gettydefs tag to use for the given line.
See @var{man gettydefs}, @var{man mgettydefs}.

@item @code{term} @var{terminal type}

If you are on Linux or similar OSes that have @code{getty} set the
@code{TERM=xxx} terminal type variable, and have no other method to set it
(e.g. from @file{/etc/profile} or @file{$HOME/.profile}), @code{mgetty} can
do it for you. Just specify @samp{@code{term} vt100} or so. I don't think
it's a good idea to specify the terminal type on a per line base (what if
all your callers use different terminal types?), so the default is
@var{unset}.

@chapter Fax Operations

Both mgetty and sendfax deal exclusively with raw ``g3'' fax files (``g3''
stands for ``group 3'', which is the CCITT standard for encoding images for
fax transmission). You will have to use external programs to create, view
or print these.

There are two kinds of g3 files, the high resolution type with 204x196
dpi and the low (``normal'') resolution ones with 204x98 dpi.  If you
mix up the two, the recipient will get a fax page that is either twice
or half the proper length. You have been warned.

The width of a fax page is always 1728 pixels, the length is arbitrary
(though there are some plain paper fax machines out there that limit the
page length to A4 paper). A typical full page has a length around 2100
pixels in high-resolution mode.

@section Converting fax files

I recommend getting the @samp{pbmplus} package written by Jeff Poskanzer,
which includes lots of small programs to convert various bitmap formats
into a portable intermediate format (@code{pbm}) that can easily be
converted to fax format with the @code{pbmtog3} program. Further, it comes
with lots of tools to scale, flip, and otherwise manipulate the @code{pbm}
bitmaps. Be warned: it includes its own version of @code{pbmtog3} and
@code{g3topbm}, so be careful which one gets installed. The programs in the
@code{mgetty} package behave slightly different (that is, they work!), and
are significantly faster.  Note that the @code{pbmplus} package does not
include a graphical front end.

The @file{pbmplus} package can be found on most major FTP sites, e.g. on
ftp.x.org in the @file{/contrib} directory. @xref{ftp}.

If you want to view the images using X11, you should get one of the many
image viewers, like @samp{xview}, @samp{xloadimage} or @samp{xv}.
@xref{Fax-Tools}. A simple, but very fast fax viewer can be found in
@file{mgetty/frontends/X11/}.

Here are some examples for viewing fax files using @code{g3topbm}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can print a fax on a PostScript printer (try @samp{lpr -Pps} if you
don't have @samp{lp}):

@example
cat $faxfile | g3topbm | pnmtops -noturn | lp -dest postscript
@end example

@item
or on an Epson-LQ, scaled for fine resolution (use -yscale 1.84 for
normal resolution):

@example
cat $file | g3topbm | pnmscale -xscale 1.76 -yscale 0.92 |\
    pgmtopbm | pbmtodot -360x180| lp -o epson -
@end example

@item
or you could view it using X11 via one of the following commands:

@example
$ g3view -v $file

$ cat $file | g3topbm >/tmp/fax.pbm ; xloadimage /tmp/fax.pbm

$ g3topbm $file | xv -
@end example

@end itemize

There are three easy ways to create g3 fax files, either use @samp{pbmtog3}
(included in this package and also in the pbmplus toolkit. @strong{Note:}
@xref{pbmtog3}), use GhostScript (GNU Software, can be found on
prep.ai.mit.edu) which contains a ``digifax'' driver that will produce the
required format, or try Chris Lewis' @samp{hp2pbm} package which will
convert HP Laserjet print files into g3 fax files (@code{hp2hig3}
program).

Once you have the right tools, there are lots of ways to create fax files
for a wide variety of applications. Here are some examples:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Ascii files can be converted using @samp{pbmtext | pbmtog3} (use a
@emph{large} font, and don't convert texts longer than about 50 lines).
Alternatively, you can convert ascii files to PostScript using
@samp{psify}, the @samp{pslp.ps} program from the ghostscript
distribution, or similar tools, and feed their output into GhostScript.

@item
PostScript input can be converted by GhostScript (version 2.4 or
higher), using the digifax (@samp{dfaxhigh} and @samp{dfaxlow}) drivers.
It will generate a plain g3 file with a 64 byte additional header, which
will be skipped automatically. (You have to generate separate g3 files,
one per page). 

A typical call to ghostscript would look like this:

@example
gs -sDEVICE=dfaxhigh -sOutputFile=/tmp/fax.g3.%d yourdocument.ps
@end example

Do @emph{not} use the ``tiffg3'' or similar drivers, they will create output
files with headers that sendfax does not understand, thus causing the
receiving fax machine to reject the data (it will assume that the
transmitted headers are garbled data).

If you use Ghostscript version 3.01 and up, you can use the @samp{faxg3}
driver as well, its output is identical to the output of the
@samp{dfaxhigh} driver except for the 64 byte header.

@item
Bitmaps can be converted using the @samp{pbmplus} tools, but you'll have
to do the proper scaling by hand. Use a pipeline with @code{pbmtog3} at the
end.

@item
@TeX{} dvi files can be converted to PostScript using @samp{dvialw} or
@samp{dvips}. If you want to get the best possible output quality, you can
use Metafont to create a set of 204x196 dpi fonts, which will look a lot
better than scaled 300 dpi fonts (look into @file{contrib/dvi-fax} for
instructions how to do this). You can use the @code{epsf} macros to include
encapsulated PostScript files, e.g. a scanned signature.

@item
Another way for @TeX{} file conversion is Ralf Schleicher's @code{faxdvi}
package, found in @file{contrib/faxdvi-0.1.tar}. Don't ask me about, ask
him!

@item
HP-Laserjet files can be translated with Chris Lewis' @file{hp2pbm}
package. It contains a program @code{hp2hig3} that will read
HP-Laserjet @file{PCL4} files and produce G3 output.

@strong{Warning:} the G3 files that hp2hig3 emits lack the leading EOL
code, thus causing @code{sendfax} to complain and possibly fail. As a quick
fix, you can pipe those files through @code{g3cat}, it will fix the data.

@end itemize

A rather crude sample conversion program (@code{faxcvt}) is provided in
the fax directory.

Better conversion, including guessing of the format of the input files,
is done by the @code{faxspool} program, also provided in the fax
directory. @xref{Queuing}.


@node Receiving, Sending, Convert, Fax
@section Receiving faxes

If everything has been set up properly, faxes will be received
automatically. Obviously, mgetty has to be listening to the proper modem
line. Then, if a fax arrives, mgetty will store it in the directory
@code{FAX_SPOOL_IN} and send a mail to @code{MAIL_TO} (defined in
@file{policy.h}).

The file name format is somewhat tricky (the reason behind it is that I
have to create something unique without using @code{mktemp()}, because that
would make it impossible to find out which pages belong to which fax). It
is:
@example
f<res><seq><line>[-<remote id>].<pagenr>
@end example
@code{<res>} is @code{n} or @code{f}, depending on the resolution of the
fax. @code{<seq>} is a sequence number, 7 digits wide, somewhat related to
the reception time. @code{<line>} are the last two letters of the tty
device, e.g. @file{S1}. If the sending side specified a fax station id,
it comes next, after a leading dash (all blanks are replaced by dashes).
Finally, after a dot, you'll see the page number.


If you want to process incoming faxes automatically, for example, print
them, re-send them to another fax, send them by mail to you when you're on
vacation, you could use what I call ``notify programs'':

If you define @code{FAX_NOTIFY_PROGRAM} in @file{policy.h}, mgetty
will call this program (or shell script) when a fax has been completely
received. It will be called with the following command line arguments:

@example
FAX_NOTIFY_PROGRAM @var{<hangup code>} '@var{<sender id}>' @var{<nr of pages>} \
                   @var{<file name page 1>} @var{<file name page 2>} @dots{}
@end example

@var{<hangup code>} is 0 if the receive was successful, non-zero
otherwise.  @var{<sender id>} is the fax identification string received
from the other side.  @var{<file name page (i)>} is the full path name for
each received page.

A sample command line might look like this:

@example
@BINDIR@/new_fax 0 "+49 89 3243328" 1 @FAX_SPOOL@/ff-01.a123
@end example

Such a ``notify program'' could print out the fax, convert it into a MIME
metamail and send it away, display it in an X window (this a little bit
tricky), or whatever. (A friend of mine uses it on his Linux box to call a
program that will make the keyboard LEDs blink when a fax has arrived -- as
you can see, maximum flexibility is possible).

I provide a few examples (printing on HP laserjet, mailing as gzip'ed,
uuencoded pbm file, @dots{}) in @file{samples/new_fax.*}


If you have the @code{dialog} shell tool, you can use the @code{faxv}
program (``faxview'') that I provide in @file{frontends/dialog/faxv} to
browse through all faxes in the incoming spool directory, view them, print
them, rename and move them, @dots{}. @file{faxv} is really more a sample
program to show you how to do it, and you have to configure the X11 viewer
and the printing program in the source code, but I use it for my faxes, and
it works. Because of limitations on some operating systems, the list of
faxes displayed is limited to the last 50 faxes received.


@node Sending, Polling, Receiving, Fax
@section Basic @code{sendfax} usage

Sendfax is very primitive---no spool management, no format conversion,
etc.  It is designed to be able to send exactly one fax (consisting of
multiple pages) to exactly one fax machine, but it is usable from
within shell scripts.  Its input are pages in ``g3'' format, either
created with ghostscript or with pbmtog3.

It is called like this:

@example
sendfax [-v] [-n] @var{<phone-number>} @var{<fax page(s)>}
@end example

e.g.

@example
sendfax 0893243328 /tmp/to_gert_1.g3 @FAX_SPOOL_OUT@/picture.g3
@end example

It will then attempt to open the fax device and send all the pages to
the remote fax machine, in the given order.

It will print little or nothing to stdout or stderr, except if it cannot
find or open one of the named files, or if some transmission errors occur.

(There are a few stubs in the code to put headers on the pages at run-time,
but since most class 2 faxmodems do not implement the command set properly,
putting a header on a page does not work with them - because of that, I had
to disable the corresponding code.  @code{faxspool} works around this
problem by using @code{g3cat} (@xref{Fax-Tools}) to ``paste'' a header line
on top of each page)

If you specify @samp{-v}, sendfax will output more verbose progress
messages.

If you specify @samp{-n}, it will try to send the fax data in normal
resolution, default is fine resolution. (No conversion is done, so make
sure that your input data is already in the proper format.)

Detailed reports can be found in the log file (usually
@file{@FAX_LOG@}) --- but they may be of little more than
technical interest since virtually all conversation with the fax modem is
logged. (Nevertheless, if you send me any bug report, @emph{please include
all log files})

@strong{Warning:} Watch sendfax closely when sending the first few
faxes. I had it abort a transfer a couple of times, not being able to
recover and @emph{not} hanging up the modem (the modem was completely
locked up, with the phone line off-hook)! In my case, it was a problem
of the modem that went away when I upgraded the firmware. Very old
ZyXEL releases sometimes stopped the DTE and forgot to re-start it again.

The return codes of the sendfax program were chosen to make it easy for
external programs (i.e. faxrunq) to decide whether to try again or not:

@example
 0: all pages transmitted successful
 1: error on command line
 2: cannot open fax device (typically happens if fax device is
    locked, but could also be a permission problem)
 3: error initializing the modem
 4: dial failed, "BUSY"
10: dial failed, "ERROR" or "NO CARRIER"
11: waiting for XON failed (should never be seen)
12: transmitting page(s) failed (or polling failed)
@end example

If the error code is less than 10, the attempt didn't cost anything, so an
external program should try again to send the files. If it is 10 or higher,
the failed attempt probably cost something, and the program should decide
whether to try again (thus expending more money) or mail the operator and
tell him something went wrong. My @code{faxrunq} program will suspend the
job after five unsuccessful tries with error codes >= 10.

@node Polling, Queuing, Sending, Fax
@section Fax polling using @code{sendfax}

Sendfax can also be used for fax polling (that is, you call someone and
initiate a fax connection, and then @emph{receive} a document. Don't
confuse it with fax-on-demand, this is something different), the syntax is:

@example
sendfax -p @var{<fax-number>}
@end example


or for sending a fax and then switch to polling:

@example
sendfax -p @var{<fax-number>} @var{<send-documents>}
@end example

(in this case @var{<send-documents>} are sent, and then the documents
from the other modem are polled, if there are any)

the received pages are written to the current directory, so make sure
you have write access...


@strong{Warning:} Fax polling does @emph{not} work with ZyXEL Modems
with ROM releases before 6.00 - with the 6.01 and 6.10 Eproms it works,
but 6.11a is broken again. 6.12 and 6.13 work fine.

It definitely doesn't work with Rockwell-based Faxmodems (Supra), since
this chipset does not support polling.

Could anybody try this with an Everex Faxmodem?


@node Queuing, Fax-Tools, Polling, Fax
@section Automated fax queuing 

For fax spooling and processing the queue, four additional utility
programs are provided:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{faxspool} will spool a number of files (accepting various formats)
and put them into the fax spool directory. Its syntax is:

@example
faxspool [options] phone-number input-file(s)
@end example
  
@samp{phone-number} can be an alias, in this case the private and global
alias files @file{$HOME/.faxnrs} and @file{@CONFDIR@/faxaliases} will be
searched for a line starting with this alias. The remainder of this line
will then be used as fax number.

@code{faxspool} interacts with the @code{file} program and
@file{/etc/magic} to determine the file type of the input files. If your
@file{/etc/magic} lacks entries for the various bitmap files, take a look
at @file{fax/etc-magic}, it contains the most important magic numbers.

@code{faxspool} reads the text to put on top of each fax page from a text
file, @file{faxheader}, located in @file{@CONFDIR@/}. This file must
contain pure ASCII text. Some tokens are replaced by the actual values:
@@T@@ becomes the destination phone number, @@P@@ becomes the actual and
@@M@@ the total page number, and @@U@@ is replaced by the user name. If
your fax modem cuts of a few lines on top of each page, it may be a good
idea to put a blank line before the header line itself, and it is also a
good idea to indent the line about 5 spaces.

For the available options, please read the @file{faxspool.1} man page.

@item
@code{faxrunq} will read this directory and try to send all the faxes
queued there (time scheduling is available, but primitive). If faxrunq
succeeds, the fax is deleted and the sender is mailed. If it does not
succeed after five tries (@samp{BUSY} or a locked fax modem do
@emph{not} count for this) it will send a mail and not try any further
to send this fax. (This should prevent your faxmodem from making you
bancrupt@dots{}).

@code{faxrunq} should be called at regular intervals from @code{cron} to
process the queued jobs. It should only be executed by @emph{root}, to
make sure that all the files in the fax spool directory are read- and
writeable.


@item
@code{faxq} will display all entries in the fax queue. If called with
the @samp{-o} parameter, it will also display completed, but not yet
deleted jobs (JOB.done files). If called with the @samp{-v} parameter, the
output will be more verbose.

Jobs that are just being sent are not shown (@code{faxq} doesn't see locked
jobs)

@item
@code{faxrm} can be used to remove fax jobs from the queue. It is called
with the job ids of the to-be-removed faxes as command line argument. The
job ids are those that @code{faxq} returns.

@end itemize

These utilities do still have some rough edges, but I think they are fairly
usable by now.

Earlier variants of those utilities had to be configured in the source
code, from release 0.20 on, this is done by @code{make}. Please check the
scripts nevertheless, whether all directories and files are set up
properly.

@node Fax-Tools, Scanner, Queuing, Fax
@section Additional tools for working with g3 files

Some additional tools are provided for manipulating G3 fax files:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
@code{g3cat} (in the @file{tools} directory) concatenates multiple G3
fax files. It accepts ``raw'' g3 files and digifax files and outputs a
``raw'' g3 file without headers. Its syntax is analogous to
@code{cat}, except that you @emph{have} to specify @file{-} to read
from @file{stdin}.

@code{g3cat} recognizes two flags: @code{-l}, to separate the fax files
with a thin black line, and @code{-a} to byte-align the end-of-line
codes in the file (Warning: some modems do not like this).

@item
To convert an incoming fax to Jef Poskanzers @file{portable bitmap}
(@code{pbm}) format, you can use the @code{g3topbm} program that is
also provided in @file{tools/}. It's advantages over Jef's
@code{g3topbm} program are that it's approximately five times faster
and takes only one eigth as much virtual memory (on machines with low
virtual memory, it can thus be up to 100 times faster!). Its disadvantage
is that it produces only ``raw'' (i.e., binary) @file{pbm} files; and
it's not as stable when handling erroneous @file{g3} data (means that
if one line is severly corrupted, it can happen that the next line
will not be decoded properly. The rest of the file will then be OK
again).

Syntax:
@example
g3topbm [-r] [-s] [-l] [-d <dpi>] [g3-file]
@end example

If no g3 file is specified, standard input is used.

The @code{-s(tretch)} option causes @code{g3topbm} to double each row of
the g3 file.  You can use this to adjust the aspect ratio of a "normal"
resolution fax file to match that of a "fine" resolution fax.  Of course
you can use other @code{pbmplus} tools for this instead, but 
@code{-s} is sure to be faster.

If you have a HP Laserjet printer, you can make @code{g3topbm} output HP
LJ data with the @code{-l} switch. The desired resolution is chosen with
the @code{-d 75|150|300} switch.

If @code{make install} detects that you have installed the @code{pbmplus}
tools before, it will move its @code{g3topbm} to @code{g3topbm.pbm}, so
you can still use it, if you want (same for @code{pbmtog3}).

@item
For the other direction, I have provided a @code{pbmtog3} program that will
convert Jef Poskanzer's Portable BitMap format into G3 fax data suitable
for faxing with @code{sendfax}. The @file{pbm} files can be produced by
various sources, e.g. drawing programs (@code{xpaint}), bitmap manipulation
programs (@code{xv}), or simply be converted from other file formats by
means of the @file{pbmplus} tools.

As above, my variant is a lot faster than Jef's, and unlike his, it
produces g3 data that adheres to the T.4 standard (if you don't fiddle too
much with the options...), so you don't have to apply any patches to make
it work together with @code{sendfax}.

Syntax:
@example
pbmtog3 [-r] [-a] [-w page with] [-h blank lines] [pbm-file]
@end example

if no pbm file is specified, standard input is used.

For a detailed description, see the @file{pbmtog3(1)} man page.

@item
@code{g3view}. To view G3 data files under X11, Frank D. Cringle has
written a very nice and fast tool that will display the files on screen,
turn them, zoom them in and out, @dots{}

The source code can be found in the @file{mgetty/frontends/X11} directory.
It's not (yet) built and installed by default, but it's straightforward.

For a detailed description, see the @file{README} and @file{g3view.man}
files in that directory.

@item
To convert an incoming fax into X-Windows @file{xwd} bitmaps, you can
use Chel van Gennip's @code{g3toxwd} program, found in the
@file{contrib/} directory.

@item
If you want to print out faxes on a HP laserjet printer, you have two
opions: you can use Chel's @code{g3tolj} program (also in the
@file{contrib/} directory), or you use my @code{g3topbm} program with the
@code{-l} option, which will make it output LJ data.

@end itemize

@node Scanner, runtime-sendfax, Fax-Tools, Fax
@section Using an external fax as a scanner

It is possible to tell mgetty to answer the phone even if it is not
ringing (I call this ``virtual rings''). Just send mgetty a signal
@code{SIGUSR1}, this is usually done with @samp{kill -USR1
@var{<mgetty-pid>}}.  Mgetty will then pick up the phone and try to make a
connection.

If you have a normal fax machine connected to the fax modem, it should
be possible to have that fax machine dial any digit (to turn off the
dial tone), and then have mgetty answer the phone to receive the
``incoming'' fax, thus using the fax machine as scanner without paying for a
call. For a description of an sample setup (thanks, caz!), please see
@file{doc/scanner.txt}.

Whether it works may depend on your phone company's setup, but it should.

If you have a modem that has a @samp{data/voice} button, it should also be
possible to hit that button to make the modem pick up the phone. Mgetty
will automatically notice that and handle it properly. (I've tested this
only with ZyXELs - could somebody else please test this with other modem
types and send me a logfile? Thanks)

@node runtime-sendfax,  , Scanner, Fax
@section Runtime configuration for sendfax: @file{sendfax.config}

Basically, @code{sendfax} can work very well with the compiled-in defaults
(from @file{policy.h}), sometimes slightly modified by command line
options.

If you use more than one fax modem, possibly of different type, this is
very awkward, because the command line will get very long. For that reason,
there is a configuration file which will control nearly every detail of
sendfax' behaviour.

It is usually named @file{@CONFDIR@/sendfax.config}.

The config file consists of multiple sections, separated from each other by
the keyword @samp{port}. All configuration options given before the
first @samp{port} statement specify global options, and everything between
two @samp{port} statements applies only for the device with the given name
(@samp{port} takes an argument). Let me show you an example:

@example
# global defaults:
# fax station id is always the same
fax-id ++49-89-1234
# always have the speaker on
modem-init ATM1L3

# port specific: for /dev/tty1a, switch the speaker off
port tty1a
modem-init ATM0L0

# port specific: for ttyS1, use another fax station id
port ttyS1
fax-id ++1234567
@end example

As you can see, empty lines and comment lines (starting with "#") are
allowed.

Every line in the config file that is not a comment - or empty - starts
with a keyword (listed in detail below), followed by a "data" field. In the
example above, @samp{fax-id} is the keyword, @samp{++49-89-1234} is the
corresponding data, the fax ID for the sending machine. Most data fields
are strings, but there are a few boolean and integer items.

The available keywords are (if it's possible to set this item from the
command line, the flag is given in brackets).

@itemize @minus
@item @code{fax-devices} [-l] @var{ttys}

Sets the fax modems to use, e.g. @samp{tty1a:tty2a}. Default is
@code{FAX_MODEM_TTYS} from @file{policy.h}. The device names given here are
used to look up the corresponding @code{port} section later. Watch out for
upper-/lowercase.

It is not very useful to specify this in the per-port section, so it is
ignored if met there.

@item @code{modem-init} [-m] @var{command}

Specifies an @samp{AT...} command that is to be sent to the modem right at
the @strong{beginning} of all modem talk (even before setting the modem
into fax mode, so this could be an @samp{ATZ} if you want to reset the
modem).

@item @code{modem-handshake} @var{command}

Specifies an @samp{AT...} command that will be sent to the modem at the
@strong{end} of the modem initialization, right before dialing. @strong{Do
not use ATZ or such here}, since resetting the modem will switch off fax
mode. Default is @code{FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE}.

@item @code{modem-type} [-C] @var{type}

Force the modem command set to use. Default is @samp{auto} (auto-detect,
which may not work on very cheap modems), possible other values are
@samp{cls2}, for ``class 2 only'' modems, and @samp{c2.0} for ``class 2.0''
faxmodems. Default is @code{DEFAULT_MODEMTYPE}. @xref{runtime-mgetty}

@item @code{max-tries} @var{nnn}

Specify the maximum number of tries per page if the receiving end reports
reception errors. If @var{nnn} tries do not suffice to successfully
transmit a page, @code{sendfax} will give up or simply go on, depending on
the setting of @code{max-tries-continue} (see below). If this is set to
@samp{0}, @code{sendfax} will ignore retransmission requests and simply go
on.  Default is @code{FAX_SEND_MAX_TRIES}.

@item @code{max-tries-continue} @var{y|n}

After the maximum number of tries for one page are reached, @code{sendfax}
can report an error and abort (@code{max-tries-continue @var{no}}), or go
on with the next page (@var{yes}).

For ``mission critical'' faxes, I'd set it to @var{no}, but since the page
quality is most often quite good even if reported as ``page bad'', the
default is @var{yes}.

@item @code{speed} @var{baudrate}

Set the port speed to use for fax send operations. Usually, @samp{38400} is
a good choice, but a few dumb modems (for example, some based on rockwell
chipsets) need @samp{19200} or even @samp{9600}. A few modems can go
higher, but @code{sendfax} may not support it, and it may not always work.
Default is @code{FAX_SEND_BAUD}.

@item @code{switchbd} @var{baudrate}

On some (very few) modems it is necessary to start with baudrate "A" and
switch to baudrate "B" after sending the @samp{AT+FCLASS=2} command. If you
specify this, @code{sendfax} will switch from @code{speed} to
@code{switchbd} right after setting the modem to class 2/2.0. Default is
@code{FAX_SEND_SWITCHBD}, I'd recommend @strong{not} using it unless you're
sure that you need it.

@item @code{dial-prefix} @var{command}

This is the command used for dialing out. Usually this will be something
simple, as @samp{ATD} or @samp{ATDP}, but if you have an unusual setup, it
could also be something like @samp{ATX0DP0;X4DT} (meaning: switch off
dial-tone detection, pulse-dial @samp{0}, back to command mode, switch on
dial-tone detection, and go ahead dialing with touch tones). The phone
number will be sent right after the @code{dial-prefix}. Default is
@code{FAX_DIAL_PREFIX}.

@item @code{fax-id} [-I] @var{your fax phone}

specifies the "fax station id" used to identify your fax machine to the
receiving end. Usually this is the telephone number of your own fax
machine, but if you want to (and if your modem support it), you can put up
to 20 alphanumeric characters here, e.g. @code{+1-11-222 Fred}. Default is
@code{FAX_STATION_ID}.

Watch out: the @code{faxspool} program does @emph{not} read sendfax' config
file, so the fax id it puts on the header might not be the same as the one
transmitted by sendfax, if you change it only in one place.

@item @code{poll-dir} [-d] @var{full path}

This is used to specify a directory where polled faxes (wheather maps and
such) are to be saved into. Default is the current directory.

@item @code{normal-res} @var{y|n} [-n]

If set to @samp{yes} or @samp{true} (boolean), @code{sendfax} won't attempt
to make a fax connection in "fine resolution" mode. Normally you won't need
to use that option, since @code{faxrunq} will set the @code{-n} switch if
needed.  Default is @samp{no}

@item @code{verbose} @var{y|n} [-v]

If set to @samp{yes} or @samp{true}, @code{sendfax} will output progress
reports on stdout, if set to @samp{no}, @code{sendfax} will only print
error and warning messages. Default is @samp{no}.

@item @code{debug} [-x] @var{nn}

controls the amount of information written into the fax log file
(@code{FAX_LOG} in @file{policy.h}). @samp{0} means "totally silent" (not
even errors are written), @samp{9} is really noisy. I usually use @samp{3}
or @samp{4} in normal use, and @samp{6} for debugging. Default is
@code{LOG_LEVEL}.

@item @code{page-header} [-h] @var{file}

Yet unused (because of implementation shortcomings in all tested modems)

@end itemize

To show you how it will look like, I have included a sample
@file{sendfax.config} file below. Three modem lines exist on my system, all
modems have different initialization and flow control commands, and on one
line I have to tell the modem to use pulse dial because the PBX is too old.

@example
#
# sample configuration file for sendfax
#

# global settings
verbose y
# the modems are attached to the following ports:
fax-devices tty1a:tty2a:tty4c

# this is my fax number

dial-prefix ATD
debug 4

# port specific overrides

# Zoom 28K8
port tty1a
  modem-handshake AT&K4

# MultiTech
port tty2a
  dial-prefix ATDP
  modem-handshake
#                ^^^ this means "no extra command to set modem handshake"

(i.e. the ZyXEL). Note that these extensions are maintained by Marc

@section Introduction

The voice extended mgetty (called @code{vgetty}) is intended for people who
want to share a phone line for data and voice use, with the main focus
being voice calls. It is @strong{NOT} intended for a dialup system that
occasionally gets a voice call, since some modems are confused by hearing
a recorded voice message and won't get a connect.

@end itemize

@node vneed,  , vfeatures, vintro
@subsection What you need

Obviously, you need a modem that supports the voice commands. I have tried
only three different models so far, I would be interested in hearing about
others.

The ZyXEL works well, as long as you don't have a ROM older than 6.01. 
(Older ROMs might work, but I wouldn't count on it). I recommend
6.13, since it introduces a new, high-quality 4-bit voice format
and hardware flow control for voice transmission, which greatly
increases the reliability.
 
The Dolphin modem should work, but I haven't tried the code for a long
time. If you have a Dolphin modem, I'd be interested to hear about your
experiences with this code. The Dolphin modem can't do FAX, but vgetty will
notice that itself. The pvfadpcm conversion doesn't work, the format is
undocumented.

Rockwell-Based modems, e.g. the Creatix 144FV, do work, but conversion of
their voice data to PVF isn't possible, because
Rockwell considers their ADPCM voice data format proprietary and
refuses to hand out informations about it, unless you sign a non-disclosure
agreement, which in turn would prevent me from giving away the source
code. Complain to Rockwell about it. Loudly!

For ZyXELs, I recommend reading the ZFax documentation (on one of the DOS
disks shipped with the modem) to find out how the
voice stuff works in general (i.e., where do I hook up a microphone etc.).
It's the file @file{zfax*.mnu} in the zfax main directory. Remember that CELP
compression is only supported by `+' models. If you use any mode other than
CELP, you will need a data rate of 38400 bps (57600 bps for the new 4-bit
ADPCM), a serial port with a 16550 UART is highly recommended on PCs.

@node vinstall, vusage, vintro, voice
@section Installation

If you have unpacked everything correctly, you should have a directory
`mgetty' which in turn contains a directory called `voice'. The
Makefile in `mgetty/' builds mgetty, the one in `mgetty/voice' builds
vgetty and the voice tools.

Make sure you have `mgetty' configured correctly and working, this package
uses most of its code. You need to edit at least policy.h to fit your
system. Have a look at the README and the mgetty parts of this manual for
instructions.

Once you have got mgetty working, you should configure the `voice' section
at the end of the main mgetty @file{Makefile}. It shouldn't be necessary to
edit @file{voice/Makefile}. You can edit `voice/voclib.h' to configure some
voice options, check the comments there for instructions. The defaults
ought to work unless you have an unusual setup.

To build vgetty, do @samp{make vgetty} in your mgetty directory. If you are
courageous you can try @samp{make vgetty-install} to set up the voice
directory and install the binaries.

Put your greeting message(s) in the messages directory and store their file
names in the @file{Index} file, then edit @file{.code} and put your remote
playback code in it.

To install vgetty, put it in an appropiate directory (i.e. /etc, /usr/etc
or /sbin) and add the command line to @file{/etc/inittab} as described in
the mgetty documentation. The command line options are the same, you will
probably want to use something like @samp{-n 4} to wait for four rings
before picking up the phone.

* vint::            Internals
@end menu

@node vint,  , vinstall, vinstall
@subsection Internals
Below is the default directory structure - if you change it, you will
have to modify the vg_* scripts. (VOICE_DIR is set in the Makefile,
the default is @VOICE_DIR@.)

@example
VOICE_DIR/messages/*  : greeting messages
VOICE_DIR/incoming/*  : received messages
VOICE_DIR/voice/vg_*  : external programs called by vgetty
VOICE_DIR/.code       : code digits for remote playing of messages
@end example

All the external programs are shell scripts, you can easily change them if
you want more features. I'd like to hear about any interesting uses.

The @code{vg_message} script contains sample code for notifying
somebody by mail about incoming phone calls and for uuencoding
the messages and sending them via email, uncomment the appropiate
sections if you want to experiment with this.

@node vusage, vutils, vinstall, voice
@section Usage

@code{vgetty} is installed just like @code{mgetty} and accepts the same
command line options. You should have a file called @file{Index} in your
greeting message directory that contains the filenames of your greeting
files, one per line. It will pick a random one when it answers the phone.

If you want to use your modem as an answering machine during the day
and for data dialin during the night, you can use `cron' to create a
file called @file{/etc/answer.<device>} which contains a single line,
either `voice/fax/data' or just `fax/data' to accept only these types
of calls. If the file exists but is empty, vgetty won't answer the
phone at all (this is in addition to the @file{/etc/nologin.<device>}
feature of @code{mgetty}). You can add a second line to specify the
number of rings to wait for, this overrides the command line setting.
Here's what my @file{/etc/answer.modem} file contains:

@example
voice/fax/data
rings 4
@end example

DTMF tones can be used to control vgetty. The effects are as follows:

@example
playback mode (during the greeting message):
	'*': stop playing, switch to recording mode.
	'#': hang up. (Use this if you answer the phone by hand after
	     the computer has started talking.)
	'0'-'9': start the external DTMF program, pass the digit as $1
@end example

@example
recording mode:
	"*<digits>#": start the external DTMF program and pass the
	     digits as $1. The '*' is optional, it can be used to
	     remove mistyped digits ("*22*345#" is equivalent to 
	     "*345#").
	'#' without leading digits: hang up the phone.
@end example

The DTMF command is used for remote playback of messages, the default
code is `*12345#' (stored in VOICE_DIR/.code). You get three tries
to enter the correct code.

If you want to make this more user friendly, you should record
three messages and store them in @file{VOICE_DIR/messages/}:

@file{get-code}: "Please enter your access code"
@file{incorrect}: "Incorrect code"
@file{goodbye}: "Goodbye"

If you have a speech synthesizer package (I use rsynth-0.9.linuxA), you
might want to take a look at the @file{speakdate} script, I use it to
append a date stamp to each recorded message. I'm not going to give a
detailed explanation of how it works, since it is going to be very much
dependent on your setup. Feel free to experiment. I have included my
patches to the rsynth code to enable it to output a voice file on stdout.

@node vutils, vbugs, vusage, voice
@section Voice utilities

Type `zplay' without arguments (or read the manpage) to get the usage
summary. The most important applications are:

@example
zplay <voice-file>   : play a file on the telco line
zplay -s <voice-file>: play a file on the external speaker
zplay -r <file>      : record a file from the telco line
                       (use your interrupt key (^C) to stop)
zplay -r -m <file>   : record a file from the external microphone
@end example

There is a short manpage for the pvf utilities, it is easy to add new
converters if you want more special effects - send them to me if you
want them integrated into the package.

Here are some examples of what you can use the tools for:

Read the adpcm file A, add one second of silence at the start and cut off
the last half second, mix it with the pvf file B, convert the result to
ADPCM-3 and store it in the file C:
@example
       adpcmtopvf <A | pvfcut -1 .5 | pvfmix B | pvftoadpcm3 >C
@end example


Convert a voice message to a format suitable for inclusion in a MIME
message:
@example
       adpcmtopvf <A | pvfspeed 1.2 | pvftobasic >B
@end example

Play a recording on a sound card:
@example
       adpcmtopvf <A | pvftoau >/dev/audio
@end example

Note that the adpcm converter works only for ZyXELs and is also dependent
on the ROM release you have. Please read the comment in the Makefile.

@subsection Miscellaneous

@itemize @bullet
@item Where can I get a CELP converter?

ZyXEL considers the CELP format to be proprietary, and won't release
information on the data format. In addition, CELP is a lot more complicated
than ADPCM, and a converter, even if the format was known, would probably
be a fairly complex program. Feel free to write one.

@item How can I play voice data recorded with a Rockwell-based modem on my
Soundcard?

Short answer: you can't.

Long answer: there is no way yet to convert Rockwell voice files to
anything else, because Rockwell won't release format specifications. They
consider it proprietary and want you to sign an NDA (which would mean that
you can't give out your source code, stupid enough).

@item I can't record a greeting message

Try calling yourself from somewhere else and use the recorded message. This
is a last resort if you can't get the microphone to work (I never did) and
you aren't allowed to connect the phone parallel to the modem (which German
Telekom doesn't permit).

@item DTMF detection doesn't work reliably

Try calling @code{zplay} directly to find out if the modem is
detecting the DTMF codes correctly, i.e. @samp{zplay -D -r /dev/null}.
You can adjust the sensitivity by tuning parameters in @code{voclib.h}
if you have a ZyXEL with 6.12 or newer ROMs.

@end itemize

@node vpnoise, vpfax, vpmisc, vbugs
@subsection Voice playback and recording is badly garbled or noisy

Loud bursts of noise, pauses or dropped sections while playing back data
files can have various reasons, here are some things you can check:

@itemize @bullet
@item Is the serial data rate high enough? If it isn't, the modem
buffers will overflow (or underflow during playback). Most voice formats
require a minimum speed of 38400 bps, the ZyXEL even needs 57600 bps for
4-bit ADPCM. If your operating system (i.e. Linux) doesn't support this
directly, you might be able to redefine the port rate using a utility like
@code{setserial}.  If you get a lot of @code{<DLE>o}s or @code{<DLE>u}s in
your log file (Rockwell modems only), your bps rate is definitely too low.

@item Is the flow control set up correctly? Check the definitions in the
Makefile and policy.h.

@item Data loss - do you have a slow machine with a bad serial chip? On a
PC, you ought to use a port with a 16550 UART.

@item Use a soft, lint-free cloth to clean your hard disk. The magnetic
dust interferes with high-fidelity applications.  (Just kidding@dots{})

@end itemize

@node vpfax, vpconnect, vpnoise, vbugs
@subsection Paper faxes get confused

A calling fax sends beeps (T.30 calling tones), which are detected by the
modem. Occasionally a calling fax will give up as soon as it hears a voice
on the line, in this case you might want to add two seconds of silence at
the start of your greeting message to give the modem a chance to detect the
beep and enter fax mode.

@node vpconnect,  , vpfax, vbugs
@subsection Calling modems don't get a connect

Some modems are confused if they hear a human voice instead of the usual
modem beeps when calling, especially cheap 2400 bps models.  This is
unfortunate, but there isn't much I can do about this.  Voice/Data
distinction is inherently difficult, the modem can't tell the difference
between a human caller who hasn't started speaking yet and a modem which
waits for the called modem to initiate the handshake, since both are
silent. The way @code{vgetty} handles this is by playing the greeting
message, and if it doesn't hear anything, switching to DATA mode. If the
calling modem isn't silent like it should be after the greeting message,
this will never happen.

Another problem is easier to fix - the calling modem has to be patient
enough to wait through the greeting message, the beep and about
seven seconds of silence without giving up, this means that the caller
has to set the chat timeout to a high enough value (i.e. ATS7=120).
If you get many data calls, you should obviously keep the greeting
message short and you might also want to decrease the silence length.
If you get very many data calls, you should get a second phone line and use
mgetty instead.

@subsection Problems common to many modem types

@itemize @bullet
@item
Disable auto-answer in the modem (@code{ATS0=0}), because it will interfere
with the manual answer done by @code{mgetty}. If you @emph{have} to use
auto-answer, set the @code{mgetty} ring-counter (@code{-n <i>}) high enough
that @code{mgetty} will never try to answer the phone manually.

@item
Make sure that your modem is set to return @emph{verbose result codes},
that is, set @code{ATV1}. Otherwise, the modem won't return @samp{CONNECT}
or @samp{RING} but @samp{1} or @samp{2} as result code, and mgetty
definitely doesn't understand that.

@item
Make sure that your modem is set to the proper dialing type (@code{ATT&W}
for touch-tone, @code{ATP&W} for pulse dialing) --- @code{sendfax} uses
@code{ATD...} to dial out, assuming that the modem knows which dialing
method to use. Alternatively, set @code{FAX_DIAL_PREFIX} in @file{policy.h}
or @code{dial-prefix} in @file{sendfax.config} accordingly.

@item
If the default modem initialization string in @file{policy.h}, which is
quite generic, doesn't work for your modem, you can either change it
according to your needs, or store all settings in the non-volatile RAM
(NVRAM) inside the modem and change the initialization strings to plain
@code{ATZ} (modem reset).

These settings ought to work with most modems:

@code{ATS0=0}: do not auto-answer, @code{E1}: echo on, @code{Q0}: send
modem responses, @code{&D3}: reset on DTR->low.

The following, for example, are ZyXEL specific things:

@code{&H3}: set handshake to RTS+CTS,
@code{&N0}: ``multi-auto'' connect, accept all known protocols,
@code{&K4}: enable v42bis/mnp5 compression.


Naturally, you can use any init string you want (but the modem has to
return OK) --- check with your modem manual.

@item
Some modems do not like the @samp{+FDCC=1,5,...} command.

In the latest version, mgetty and sendfax will automatically detect if the
modem isn't able to do 14400 bps for faxing and will use 9600 bps ---
@samp{+FDCC=1,3,...} --- instead.

@item
Sometimes mgetty cannot initialize the modem, it times out waiting for
the first @samp{OK}.

I assume that the problem is the DTR-induced modem reset before
sending the first @samp{+++ATH} to the modem.
I know that some modems need quite a lot time after a reset, so this
should go away if you add more delays before sending the first string
to the modem:

In @file{conf_mg.c} (line 38 or so) change

@example
char *def_init_chat_seq[] =
           @{ "", "\\d\\d\\d+++\\d\\d\\d\r\\dATQ0V1H0", "OK",
@end example

to

@example
char *def_init_chat_seq[] =
           @{ "", "\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d+++\\d\\d\\d\r\\dATQ0V1H0", "OK",
                   ^^^^^^^^^ additional delays here
@end example


(please report if that cured the problem, and on which OS / Modem you
did this).

@item
Some operating systems send their commands too fast for some modems (Linux
is known to do this). In that case it may be necessary to increase the
delay times for @code{DO_CHAT_SEND_DELAY} and @code{FAX_COMMAND_DELAY} in
@file{policy.h}.

@item
Some Modems toggle DCD between pages, possibly correlated to the presence of
the ``high speed'' page transmission carrier. @code{sendfax} normally runs
carrier-sensitive, and will then get a lot error messages in the
@code{read} and @code{write} calls, logging them as @code{I/O Error} or
something similar when sending the first or second page. To work around
this, define @code{FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER} in @file{policy.h}.

@item
Some other Modems cannot (or not properly) distinguish between calling
faxes and calling modems.

Some of them just refuse to answer both, only recognizing one and failing
on the other (NO CARRIER) --- in that case, there's nothing you can do to
make it receive both (except making the manufacturer fix it). What you can
do is to force it to receive always fax or always data (what is more
important for you). Data-Only can be set by the @code{data-only} keyword in
the configuration file, and Fax-Only with the @code{fax-only} keyword.

In some cases, those problems may be caused by the modem forgetting the
@code{AT+FAA=1} command if it receives any other command after it. To fix
it, it may help to change the ``answer chat command'' in the config file to

@example
answer-chat "" AT+FAA=1;A CONNECT \c \r
@end example

if this helps for your modem, please tell me so, and I'll include it into
the documentation.

Some other modems can distinguish the different call types @emph{most of
the time}, but some 2400 bps modems mysteriously fail. That may be caused
by some -- strange -- modems sending a certain tone when @emph{calling} the
other side, and the receiving end mistaking that for the fax calling tone.
Arne Marschall said about that: ``...Or try calling your modem with your
phone and whistle. If it says ``+fcon'' it is one one those which can't
deal with modems using a calling tone'' - try it.

Another, quite simplistic approach of some modem manufacturers is that
they distinguish Fax by waiting until the time specified in register
@code{S7} (time to carrier) runs out, and then switching from data to
fax carrier. That normally works quite well - if the other side is patient
enough to wait that long @dots{}. For example, if the modem
switches to fax after 60 seconds have passed, and the caller has a timeout
of 50 seconds, it will definitely fail. If in doubt, try setting
@code{ATS7=30} (but only if all else fails - and don't ask @emph{me} why it
doesn't work...)

@item
Except if you @strong{know} that your modem needs less, do not try to
send or receive faxes with a port speed of less than 19200 bps. Since fax
transmission is synchronous (no start and stop bit!), you need at least
12000 bps on the Computer-Modem line to transmit 9600 bps on the line.

@item
For some modems, incoming faxes are detected properly, but mgetty times out
about two minutes later in @code{fax_wait_for(OK)}. Most likely, the
@code{FAX_RECEIVE_SWITCHBD} (@file{policy.h}) resp. @code{switchbd}
(@file{mgetty.config}) speed is set wrongly. Nearly all cheapo modems
(e.g. Rockwell-Chip based ones) step to 19200 bps upon fax reception, and
setting this option to @samp{19200} will tell mgetty about it. Better
modems have no need for that, so if you have defined it and your modem
does *not* change bit rates, it won't work either.

@item
For a couple of modems, you can find initialization and setup hints in the
file @file{doc/modems.db}. Just browse through it, maybe you'll find
something helpful. (You're welcome to provide entries for modems not yet
in the list).

@item
Sometimes, very weird things happen upon login (that is, long after
@code{mgetty} has done its work), for example, /bin/login blocks
infinitely, the caller is thrown out immediately again, or the shell won't
notice a logout, etc.

Quite often, this is caused by a modem not setting the data carrier detect
(DCD) line properly (properly meaning here "reflecting the actual line
conditions"). On most modems this is done with the @code{AT&C1} command.

Another possibility are too long or otherwise broken modem cables that
corrupt the signals, and introduce noise on the modem control lines. Flat
cables are famous for this, use round, shielded modem cables, no longer
than necessary.

@end itemize

@node Zyxel, TelelinkIMS08, Common, Modems
@subsection ZyXEL

First of all, yes, ZyXELs tend to somewhat non-deterministic behaviour -
most modems work perfectly with @code{mgetty+sendfax}, a few don't, and I
do not always find out what's wrong.

If it works first, and then suddenly stops working, it does quite often
help do to a @strong{full} modem reset, that is, switch it off, press the
DATA/VOICE key, switch it on again and hold the key for about 20 Seconds.
(That's for the 1496E and E+, for other models, it works differently,
check you manual). That cured the problems in many cases.

The same holds true after a firmware change: always do a full modem reset
in case you change the ROM version!

Do not use non-plus ZyXELs (the ``slower'' ones) for faxing with DTE
speeds above 38400 bps, I got a report that it won't work.

Do not use the @code{S18} register, set it to 0. Its purpose is for dumb
@code{getty} programs where the modem has to change its baud rate back to a
certain value if some other program has modified it. Since @code{mgetty}
will reinitialize the modem anyway if another program has dialed out, the
@code{S18} register cannot improve anything, it can only harm (e.g., if it
is set to @code{3}, the modem will send any @code{RING} with 19200 bps ---
imagine what happens if @code{mgetty} sets the port to 38400 @dots{})

If you want to use Caller ID (and have subscribed to it), add S40.2=1 to
the modem initialization string.

@strong{Warning:} If you use an old ZyXEL and try to send some complex
graphics (the ``tiger.ps'' example file in the GhostScript package is
known to produce this), it may lock up. This is because the ZyXEL
firmware had @emph{lots} of bugs concerning hardware flow
control---sometimes the ZyXEL just forgot to raise CTS when it can
accept data again. The symptoms are that the transmission hangs, no
modem LEDs are flashing any more, the logfile won't grow any more and
the receiving machines hangs up after printing a partial page.

This bug has been fixed in ROM release 6.01, so you should consider
upgrading your eproms if you run into this. With ROM release 6.01 and
6.11a, it works correctly (a hundred-odd faxes sent without problems).

Rom releases I've never been able to make @code{sendfax} work reliably are
6.00 and 6.10 (6.10a works), and various 5.0x releases.

Fax polling (both server and client side) is broken in ROM 6.11a.

The very latest ROM releases, 6.12 and 6.13, work perfectly in every
possible aspect. I tried fax sending, receiving, polling, data calls,
@dots{} - and everything simply @emph{works}!

The latest ZyXEL roms can normally be found on ftp.sdsc.edu, in
@file{/pub/other/zyxel/r*}.

Some models, seemingly only the @samp{EG+} (german telekom approved),
toggle the DCD line during the pre-page handshake, thus causing
@code{sendfax} to abort (with a ``I/O error'' during read/write
operations). You can work around this by defining
@code{FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER} in @file{policy.h}.

ZyXEL modems can do security callback (@code{AT*Gi} with @code{i} > 0).
With ROM releases up to 6.11a, this doesn't interact very well with
mgetty. If you want to use it anyway, send me a note and I'll describe
what to change (but be warned, mgetty operation will become somewhat
unreliable by those changes!). With 6.12, it works very good.

Oh, one additional note: ZyXELs can do voice recording and playback. Klaus
Weidner wrote a mgetty-derived program, @code{vgetty}, that will implement
an answering machine and a small voice mailbox using a ZyXEL. If you're
interested, you can find the source in the @file{voice} subdirectory.
(Note that there is no @file{vgetty.c}, it is built from @file{mgetty.c}.
If you have questions relating to vgetty only, please ask Klaus and not me
(I do not know anything about voice, I'm the fax and data guru). His e-mail
address is klaus@@snarc.greenie.muc.de.

@node TelelinkIMS08, Rockwell, Zyxel, Modems
@subsection Telelink IMS 08 Faxline+ Modems

Thanks to friendly support by MVS, Germany, I got a Telelink IMS 08 modem
for testing and was able to adapt @code{mgetty} accordingly.

The modems factory defaults are very good, so it's sufficient for
@code{mgetty} operations to set @code{init-chat} (in @file{mgetty.config})
to @var{ATQ0V1E0 OK AT&F2S0=0&D3X6&K3 OK}, and @code{switchbd} to
@var{19200} (yep, it switches baud rate.  Stupid, but true). After that,
receiving fax + data calls works fine.

Fax sending is not that trivial. Basically, it works after setting
@code{modem-handshake} to @code{AT&K3}. @code{FAX_SEND_FLOW} (in
@file{policy.h}) can be anything that the host machine supports (because
the modem does both Xon/Xoff and RTS/CTS handshake simultaneously).

Unfortunately, a few problems remain:

-- faxing multi-page faxes to ZyXELs with ROM release 6.11a doesn't work
(fails on the receiving end with +FHNG:100 and on the sending side with
+FHNG:50).

-- faxing to some paper fax machines fails completely, for others, ``only''
complex graphics (like the Ghostscript-``tiger.ps'') fail. This one can be
partially cured by adding lots of padding zeroes into the fax data
(@code{g3cat -p 24}) - but that's unelegant, not complying to class 2
specs, and not supported (besides, it still doesn't work all the
time). Maybe later versions of @code{sendfax} will do the padding
automatically.

I recommend against using this modem with sendfax. In addition to the
technical problems, their customer support (at least, that of the german
distributor MVS) is basically non-existant. (I wrote them four times
describing my problems with the modem, and never got an answer).

@node Rockwell, Zoom-vfast, TelelinkIMS08, Modems
@subsection Rockwell-based modems, e.g. Supra

As far as I know, sending or receiving are no problem (although you have to
use 19200 baud when in class 2 faxmode - set @code{speed} to @code{19200}
in @file{sendfax.config}, and set @code{switchbd} to @code{19200} in
@file{mgetty.config}. Remember to change the modem initialization strings
to the proper values for your modem, that is, @var{ATQ0V1E0 OK AT&K3S0=0 OK}.

Especially for the @samp{SupraFax} modem, I've been told that you have to
set @code{modem-handshake} to @code{AT&K3} and initialize the modem with
@code{AT&S0&D2&K3}. Since the modem does not like being reset with DTR->low
(do @strong{not} use @code{&D3}!), an @code{ATZ} in the first
initizalization string in @file{mgetty.c}, to reset the modem into a known
state, is a good idea, too.

(Thanks to Christof Junge, chris@@cj.in-berlin.de, for trying out several
weeks until everything worked!)

Some other SupraFAX Rom releases seem to forget that they are set to use
RTS/CTS handshake if a @code{+FCLASS=0} is sent to them. I think it should
help to store the @code{AT&K3} into NVRAM, but maybe you have to patch
@file{mgetty.c}. See @file{contrib/readme.supra} for details.

Fax polling does not work because the Rockwell chipset does not support it.

@subsection Zoom VFP/VFX 24K FaxModem (V.FAST modem, 24,000 bps)

For the Zoom V.FAST 24,000 modem, you should change @code{init-chat} to
@code{ATE1Q0V1 OK AT&FS0=0&C1&D2W1 OK} (see the manual for the meaning of
the commands). After that, everything should work. (I got very euphoric
reports).

My own experience with my Zoom VFX 28.800 is also quite good, but it
doesn't seem to like automatic fax/data distinction too much, that is, some
data calls are ``recognized'' as fax and fail miserably. Dunno how to fix
it, I run my Zoom as data-only.

Fax polling doesn't work.

@node Best14496EC, GVC, Zoom-vfast, Modems

Works quite well. Use @code{FLOW_HARD} for all flow control settings (in

@code{modem-init} to @code{ATE1Q0V1 OK ATS7=60&D3\\Q3%C1\\N7 OK}
(@file{mgetty.config}), and @code{modem-handshake} to @code{AT\\Q3&S0}

Further, if your model toggles DCD betwen fax pages (@code{sendfax} fails

After that, it should work.

Note: If your modem doesn't properly distinguish incoming fax from data
calls (i.e., a 2400 bps caller is repeatedly ``identified'' as fax caller),
upgrade your firmware. I've been told (thanks to John Watson,

@subsection German Telekom approved GVC modems

(GM-144VBIS+  RC9696/14 (?))

This modem does @emph{not(!)} use Xon/Xoff flow control. Further, the default
modem profile sets @samp{&S1}, which makes the modem disable DSR all the
time. On systems using the FAS serial driver, this will @emph{disable
CTS flow control}!

So, #define @code{FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE "AT\\Q3&S0"} in @file{policy.h}, do not
define @code{FLOW_SOFT} for flow control, and fax sending should work. (It
does for me!)  Changing @code{FAX_SEND_BAUD} to @code{B19200} is not
necessary, it works with @code{B38400}.

Fax receiving... I did not fully test it. It's somewhat difficult since
that modem insists on using auto-answer, but it should be possible to let
it auto-answer if you set mgetty's ring counter high enough. Or, you can
trick the modem, by changing mgetty's answer command (@code{ATA}) into
@code{ATS0=1} -- upon the next RING, the modem will ``auto-answer''.

@subsection MultiTech modems (MT1432BG and MT2834BG)

First of all, I want to thank MultiTech Munich for their support (borrowing
me two test modems w/o charge).

Second, I can only strongly recommend these modems, they are @strong{great}
(but expensive). Got it, unpacked it, switched it on, set mgetty's init
string (@code{MODEM_INIT}) to @code{ATS0=0&S1} -- and everything simply
worked. Flawlessly. (Warning: usually I recommend @code{AT&S0} to force the
DSR line high -- needed, because otherwise some O/Ses won't do hardware
flow control -- but that doesn't seem to work on my model. AT&S1 means that
H/W flow control only works when a carrier is present, but then, who needs
flow control in command mode?)

The modems do very reliably distinguish incoming fax and data calls, and
outgoing fax works also very good (unfortunately, it's limited to 9600 bps
fax rate, but that's no big problem).

The only problem I've seen is that those modem do the fax bit order on
reception @strong{right} (everybody else does it wrong, to be compatible
with Rockwell, who botched it in the first place). Thus, @code{g3topbm}
won't be able to decode the data, unless you call it as @code{g3topbm -r}.
(You can see if the bit order is wrong if g3topbm complains in every single
line). I'll work something out for one of the next releases to work around
this (@var{modem-type cls2ok}).

Glenn Thobe suggested the following definitions for @file{policy.h} (which
mostly are factory defaults anyway, but it wouldn't harm to set them)

@example
#define MODEM_INIT_STRING	"ATS0=0Q0&D3&E1&E4&E13&E15"
#define FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE "AT&E4"

@subsection USR Courier/Sportster Fax/Data modems

After long wait, the USR Faxmodems finally have a faxmode. It's class 2.0,
which is quite good for compatibility/standardization reasons.
Unfortunately, their tech guys aren't very clever, so their implementation
has bad bugs, depending on the ROM release.

Very old USR modems had the nasty habit of interpreting the "maximum
connection speed" setting as "minimum speed", thus failing to connect to
any non-14400 fax machine. This is fixed.

All of them insist on switching the baud rate to 19200 when receiving a
fax, but, alas, not at the same place in the protocol Rockwell uses, but at
yet another place.

Those two get taken care of if you @code{#define FAX_USRobotics} in
@file{policy.h}.

Another problem that appeared recently is that they have severe bugs when
doing RTS/CTS (that is, hardware) flow control. Occasionally, a byte gets
lost, and sometimes this confuses the modem enough to abort transmission
with the error message
@example
Transmission error: +FHNG:44 (Unrecognized Transparent data command)
@end example
Sam Leffler recommends using Xon/Xoff flow control for both fax sending and
fax receiving (@code{#define FAX_SEND_FLOW FLOW_SOFT} and @code{#define
FAX_REC_FLOW FLOW_SOFT} in @file{policy.h}).

Some day in the future, I'll make those "quirks" configurable from the
config file, but until then, you'll have to live with recompiling. Sorry.
(Buy a decent modem!).

@node Elink-ISDN, Class 1, USR, Modems
@subsection Elink ISDN Terminal Adaptors 293, 310, 393 with X.75 and V.110

The TA's are connected to national German ISDN (1TR6) or Euro-ISDN. The
host side is a standard serial port with an AT-command set, letting them
look like a conventional modem. Therefore they are often (wrongly) called
'ISDN modems'.

It is strongly recommended to feed them with 115k2 bps, else only V.110
(38k4 bps) is available. Configuration may differ slightly, depending on
which of those Elinks is used, wether it is connected to Euro-ISDN or 1TR6
and last but not least they are still under developement, so you're on your
own with that.

ISDN generally supports two nice features: first it is now possible to
check callers number, which may be used to identify callers, second ist
the charge service, where it is possible to request the amount of charge
units for the call. For mgetty the second one is only from minor interest,
but the first one is.  The opposite phone number will be shown with the
command @code{AT\O}. If a call comes in, @code{AT\OA} will answer the
call, display caller's id in a 'digit only' (e.g. @samp{04419808550}) form
and then print out the @code{CONNECT}-String.

To enable mgetty to utilize this, the "get caller ID" sequence must be set
up accordingly and the @samp{CND} feature must be enabled:

Use @code{cnd-chat "" AT\O OK} in @file{mgetty.config}, and add
@code{-DELINK} to the @code{CFLAGS=...} section in @file{Makefile}.
Further, @code{#define CNDFILE "@dots{}/dialin.config"} at the end of
@file{policy.h}.

With the resulting mgetty it is now possible to use @code{dialin.config}
as suggested (well, it should be, but I'm not sure, nobody tested it in a
long time).

Having a glance at the output of @code{AT I4}-output of the Elink, it looks
as if it is able to support Fax-Service too, but there is no hint in the
manual. So mgetty will likely put itself into data-only mode. (I got some
information from the Elink people that some of the Elinks have a data/fax
analog modem built in, which should work nicely with the fax part of
@code{mgetty}, but I didn't try yet.)

If your system is not in the list, that doesn't mean it won't work. It
just means that I didn't get a report (or a port) for that system yet.

mgetty+sendfax should work on most unixoid operating systems, as long as
they provide @code{SysV termio} or @code{POSIX termios} call for tty
management. @code{BSD sgtty} support isn't finished yet.

For best results, your system should have @code{select(S)} or
@code{poll(S)}, but if both functions are not available or don't work on
ttys (@code{poll(S)} is known to do this on SVR3.1 and earlier), you can
use a kludge, @code{-DUSE_READ}.

Besides that, you'll need some fiddling with the header files to get all
defines and prototypes right.

Further, you'll have to check @file{tio.c}, function
@code{tio_set_flow_control()}, whether the way hardware flow control is
activated works on your system. Most likely, it won't --- that's one of the
major portability problems. If you change something and get it to work,
please send me patches. (You're welcome to do so anyway).

@node SCO-322, SCO-324, Systems, Systems
@subsection SCO Unix 3.2.2 (ODT 1.0 / 1.1)

No major twiddling needs to be done. If your @code{select()} refuses to
sleep less than one second, use poll(S) instead (set @code{-DUSE_POLL} in
the CFLAGS section of @file{Makefile}).

Use the modem-control devices for mgetty and dial-outs (e.g.
@file{/dev/tty2A}), or (far better), use FAS with minor number of 80+port,
using full RTS + CTS handshake, and non-blocking opens (@file{/dev/ttyF01})
- the original SCO serial driver is slow, unreliable and doesn't do proper
hardware flow control. @xref{SCO-324}.

Ignore all the warnings about ``passing arg 2 of signal from
incompatible pointer type''. They are caused because the SCO 3.2.2
development system header files are somewhat unusual.

If it doesn't work, or some weird things happen on login (e.g., zmodem
downloads do not work), try compiling with -DSYSV_TERMIO. I had some
problems with Posix termios on SCO ODT 1.0.

@node SCO-324, Linux, SCO-322, Systems
@subsection SCO Unix 3.2.4 (ODT 2.0 and ODT 3.0)

I'm using mgetty on SCO 3.2v4(.2) (in fact, developing it there), so be
assured: it works.

I consider the way that hardware flow control is handled on SCO to be
broken, so I @emph{strongly} recommend using the @code{FAS} serial driver
(version 2.11 or higher, earlier versions may crash the system), to be
found on your nearest comp.sources.unix archive. With @code{fas}, use the
devices with a minor number of @samp{80+port number} for best results. Make
sure that your modem enables the @samp{DSR} line, because otherwise,
@code{FAS} won't do hardware handshake.

If you don't use @code{fas}, I've been told that you have to use the
@samp{modem control} lines, that is, the ``uppercase'' lines, e.g.
@file{/dev/tty1A}, because SCO's serial driver won't do any hardware flow
control at all on the ``lowercase'' lines. Be warned, the driver will also
disable hardware flow control if you use Xon/Xoff flow control (no way to
use both). Since I do not have a SCO system without @code{fas}, I'd like to
hear very much about results on one.

Also, you've to define @code{LOCKS_LOWERCASE}, since that's the convention
on SCO Unix and most other programs expect it.

If mgetty works only partially, but hangs the moment @file{/etc/issue}
is printed, before the `system!login:' prompt is output, you may have to
change the following line of @file{mgetty.c} (around line 780):

@example
        /* honor carrier now: terminate if modem hangs up prematurely
         */
        tio_carrier( &tio, TRUE );
@end example

to:

@example
        tio_carrier( &tio, FALSE );
@end example

But before you do this, make sure that your modem enables the CD line
while a carrier is present (Hayes modems: @samp{AT&C1}) and also enables
the DSR line (otherwise the port will block once @code{CLOCAL} is
removed).

This could have been a problem specific to Uwe's dumb AST-compatible
fourport card, but I do not think so.


Compilation issues:

Ignore warnings about @samp{struct utimbuf} and @samp{struct timeb}, they
are caused by improper include files. On SCO 3.2v4.2, ignore the warnings
about the getopt() prototype, or change prototype or include files.


Installation:

SCO provides two utilities to manipulate @file{/etc/inittab},
@code{enable} and @code{disable}. Those tools work only if you have
specified a gettydefs tag on the @code{mgetty} command line, otherwise
they will complain about ``not a valid tty''. So, either append the
gettydefs tag (@code{mgetty} will ignore it if not compiled with
@code{USE_GETTYDEFS}) or change @file{/etc/inittab} manually.

@node Linux, ISC, SCO-324, Systems
@subsection Linux

Hardware handshake (RTS+CTS) on Linux works flawlessly (but only if mgetty
is compiled with POSIX_TERMIOS, but that is default on Linux
anyway). Nevertheless, the @code{scrts.c} program in @file{contrib/} is
still provided, it has some other uses, too.

Linux versions prior to 0.99pl15 have a bug in the serial handshake code,
that is, if the @code{CRTSCTS} flag is set, software (Xon/Xoff) flow
control won't work. Teodore Ts'o promised me to fix it in newer kernels, I
think the fix went into 99pl14n or so.

If you have very old (4.1) or otherwise broken (4.4.2) shared libraries,
the alarm() call does not work reliably. This results in a fax receive
aborting with a message like ``alarm clock'' or something similar
(sometimes in the same second that the fax reception started). Upgrade
your libraries to 4.4.1 or 4.4.4.

Linux has no poll(S), so, don't #define @code{USE_POLL}, and the default,
@code{USE_SELECT}, will be used.

@strong{Important note:} Use the @file{/dev/ttyS*} devices for getty and
for dial-out (that is, for kermit, uucico, cu, seyon, ...) - @strong{never}
use @file{/dev/cua*}. Dialing out on @file{/dev/cua*} will result in the
error message ``device busy''. (There are reasons why @code{mgetty} cannot
use the ``@file{ttyS*} vs. @file{cua*} kernel locking mechanism'', see
below), and dialing in (ugh) on @file{/dev/cua*} will result in dozens of
strange things happening because the process may not get a controlling tty.

Some guys seemingly can't resist posting misinformation to the net all the
time, don't believe 'em. The @file{/dev/cua*} devices are @strong{not}
different from the @file{/dev/ttyS*} devices concerning data flow or modem
control lines. The only difference is how the device reacts if you do an
@code{open()}: Opening @file{/dev/ttyS*} normally blocks until the ``carrier
detect'' line goes active (unless @code{open()} is called with the
@code{O_NDELAY} flag; @code{mgetty} and all dial-out programs do that), and
opening @file{/dev/cua*} will return an error message (@code{errno=EBUSY})
if another process has the device already open, thus @emph{preventing
dial-out on @file{/dev/cua*}} if @code{mgetty} is active on
@file{/dev/ttyS*}.

We use @file{/dev/ttyS*} all the time for dial-in @emph{and} for dial-out,
and believe me, it works, and it's the @emph{only} combination that will
work properly. The kernel locking mechanism only works if you use modem
auto-answer (the getty process sleeps until the modem gets a carrier), and
mgetty uses manual answer (it waits for the RING message from the modem),
which will save your callers a lot of grief because their calls will
only be answered if your computer is ready to receive a call. Part of the
motivation for writing mgetty was being tired of losing lots of money
for useless calls to a hung machine.

I'd recommend against using @file{/dev/modem} as a link to the real
device, but if you do that, make it a @strong{hard link} to the
appropriate @file{/dev/ttyS*}. A soft link will cause problems with the
device ownership because of a peculiarity in the linux @code{chown()}
implementation (that I refuse to work around).

There are various different @code{init} and @code{last} programs out there,
some work with mgetty, some don't. If you get some strange output from
@code{who} or @code{last} and are using a different @code{init} program
than the @code{sysv init}, try to define @code{-DNO_SYSVINIT}. That should
help.

I've been told that it's necessary to do that if you use the
@code{simple-init}.

Anyway, I can only @strong{strongly} recommend to switch over to
@code{SysVinit} if you use @code{simple init}, since the latter seems to
be severely broken regarding utmp and controlling tty handling.

If you have problems because of an uninitialized @code{TERM} environment
variable (which really isn't getty's job, but @code{getty_ps} insists on
doing it, and people rely on it), use the @code{term @dots{}} config file
option to set it according to your needs.

If you're experiencing problems with hanging @code{/bin/login} processes,
@xref{login-hang}.

First of all, define @code{-DISC} in the Makefile. This will take care

If you have a ISC Unix 4.0, you may have to define @code{-D_POSIX_SOURCE}

If you have problems with the AWK programs in the @file{fax/} shell

Again, for best results I recommend using the FAS serial driver, and
using a port with a minor number of 80+portno (ttyF01 etc.)

If you use a Digiboard smart serial cart (e.g. the digiboard pc/8e), use
the @file{/dev/ttyi*} devices instead of @file{/dev/cui*}, becaus only the

mgetty has been ported to SVR4 now (many thanks to Bodo Bauer,

As far as I know, it's sufficient to add @samp{-DSVR4} to the CFLAGS in
Makefile. If you have any problems or suggestions, please report them also
to the people above, since I do not have a SVR4-System to run tests on.

If you use the @code{SAS} serial driver (streams-version of @code{FAS}) and
want to force @code{sas} to use hardware-handshake all the time, use a
device with a minor device number of @code{80+port number} (see the
@code{sas} manual for explantations). If you use a port with a minor device
number of @code{7*16+i}, @code{mgetty} is able to switch hardware handshake
on and off according to the flags set in policy.h, using
@file{sys/termiox.h}. (Well, it works - but apparently fax reception
doesn't work with this minor device number. Symptom: only one byte is
received during fax reception (0x00). Anybody any clue?). 

If you use @code{FAS}, use the devices with a minor device number of
@code{80+port number} (as usual).

@node SVR42, BSD, SVR4, Systems
@subsection SVR4.2 - Onsite Unix, UnixWare, ...

Basically, SVR4.2 is quite similar to SVR4, but you have to watch out for
some details (defining @code{-DSVR42} in the Makefile will do it for you).

Most important, the @emph{termiox} interface via the @code{TCGETX} /
@code{TCSETX} @code{ioctl()}s does not seem to work any longer - the calls
return an error, and the port behaves strangely. If you're experiencing
this, please try commenting out the corresponding code in @file{tio.c},
funtion @code{tio_set_flow_control()} and mail me whether that make it
work.

Further, ussing @code{USE_POLL} or @code{USE_READ}, won't work. The default
of @code{USE_SELECT} is OK.

To enable hardware handshake, use the tty device with the trailing ``h'',
e.g.  @file{tty01h}. On the other one (@file{tty01}), the driver won't do
H/W handshake.

Depending on the configuration, parallel dial-out with Taylor-UUCP may fail
(uucico complaining that it cannot set @code{CLOCAL}), in that case, you've
to recompile Taylor with different settings for the @code{termio} selection
(POSIX vs. SYSV).

Many thanks to Joerg Weber (joerg@@interface-business.de) for finding all
those problems.

Ed Hall (edhall@@rand.org) found another major glitch on UnixWare 4.2: if
you run @code{sendfax} without @code{#define}ing
@code{FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER} in @file{policy.h}, and @code{sendfax}
switches off carrier detection at the end of the very last page, the
kernel code messes up something and bytes get lost. The modem then returns 
funny error codes, like, for example,
@example
Transmission error: +FHNG:44 (Unrecognized Transparent data command)
@end example
If you're experiencing this, just @code{#define FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER}
and everything should work just fine (please tell me in any case whether
it was necessary, because if it happens for other people as well, I'll
make this permanent on SVR42).

I think it works quite well, except that the @code{VTIME} mechanism to

@code{mgetty} hangs, with the last line in the log file being something
like ``waiting for line to clear'', upgrade your kernel, or, if you can't

For older versions of BSD Unix that do not have @file{termios.h}, you'll

Generally, BSD Unices do not have a @file{/etc/inittab} as system V has.

@node AIX, SunOS, BSD, Systems
@subsection IBM's AIX Operating System

Chris Lewis, Harald Milz and Michael Staats have done excellent work on
porting @code{mgetty} to AIX. I think that some problems may still remain,
but as far as I know, it works now.

On AIX it's not allowed to manipulate @file{/etc/inittab} directly,
instead, you've got to use some system administration tools. To ease
@code{mgetty} installation on AIX, Michael Staats has provided a small
shell script, @code{inittab.aix}, that will help you setup your
@file{inittab} after you've run @code{make install}. Just call it with the
name of the tty you're modem is connected to, e.g. 

@code{./inittab.aix tty0}.

@node SunOS, Solaris2, AIX, Systems
@subsection SunOS 4.1.1 and up

mgetty has been ported to SunOS, and seems to work quite well.  If you use
SunOS, please send me a brief report about your results.

Thanks to Earl Hartwig, earl@@fozzi.ocunix.on.ca, for the initial port.

For compilation, please define @code{-Dsunos4}.

In @file{policy.h}, you've to adapt the location of the LOCK files.

In the Makefile, set @code{ECHO='...'} to
@code{/usr/5bin/echo}, because the standard one doesn't
support escape codes like @samp{\n} or @samp{\c}. Alternatively, if you
don't have the System5 options installed, use @code{mg.echo}.

If a fax reception hangs shortly after the @samp{+FCON} is seen, please try
setting @code{FAXREC_FLOW} to Xon/Xoff (@code{FLOW_SOFT}). Hardware
handshake has problems on SunOS versions without the ``Jumbo TTY'' patch.

Please use the ``outgoing'' devices (@file{/dev/cua*}) for mgetty and
dial-outs, using the ``incoming'' devices (@file{/dev/tty*}) will make
dialout impossible.

It is strongly recommended that you install the ``jumbo tty patch'' (patch
number 100513-04 for 4.1.2 or .3, patch number 101621-01 for 4.1.3_u1 and
up) because it will fix a lot misbehaviour of the serial line drivers.

Please read also the generic BSD section.
@node Solaris2, 3b1, SunOS, Systems
@subsection Solaris 2.3 and 2.4

mgetty runs successfully and without trouble under Solaris 2.3 and 2.4.
For compilation use @code{-Dsolaris2}. With Solaris 2.3 it's recommended to use
GNU gcc, but with Solaris 2.4 it compiles fine with the SPARCompiler C 3.0.1.
Define @code{CC=cc}.

In @file{policy.h} you have to define @samp{term/a} or @samp{term/b} as
@code{FAX_MODEM_TTYS}. Don't use the outgoing devices @samp{/dev/cua/*}!!

As @code{DEVICE_GROUP} you should configure @samp{uucp}.  If you want allow
to normal users to dial out, add all users allowed to do that, to the group
@samp{uucp}. Then it's important to change the permissions of
@file{/var/spool/locks} from the default permissions @samp{drwxr-xr-x} to
@samp{drwxrwsr-x}. Make sure that it's owned by @samp{uucp.uucp}.
Otherwise no one wanting to dial out is able to create a lock file.  The
@code{FILE_MODE} in @file{policy.h} must be @samp{0660} as well.

If you don't want allow anyone to dial out you should set @code{FILE_MODE}
to @samp{0640} or @samp{0600}.

For the "notify mail" message to look best, define @code{MAILER} in
@file{policy.h} to @var{/usr/lib/sendmail} and define
@code{NEED_MAIL_HEADERS}. So a proper subject header is created.
Nevertheless, @code{/usr/bin/mailx} works, as it is the default for SVR4.

If everything compiled well and you did @code{make install}, you have to
add an entry to @file{/etc/inittab} like the following:

@example
ya:234:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty -s 38400 -x 3 term/a
@end example

@emph{Don't use the Solaris @code{admintool} to create any port monitoring
entries in @file{/etc/saf/_sactab} and @file{/etc/saf/zsmon/_pmtab}.}

Many thanks to Stefan Muehlenweg (muehlenw@@samhh.hanse.DE) for this section.

@node 3b1,  , Solaris2, Systems
@subsection AT&T 3b1

Glenn Thobe and Chris Lewis have ported mgetty+sendfax to AT&T's 3B1
machines, it should compile without changes to the source (but define
-D_3B1_ in the Makefile).

These ports are to two different environments:

Glenn's port was with GCC (ANSI C) and an add-on select() library routines. 
Chris's port was with stock 3b1 C, without select().
Both seem reliable.

Some further hints concerning a select() library and the pbmplus tools can
be found in the file @file{contrib/3b1} which are the notes from Glenn's
port.

Chris's port relies simply on the suggested definitions (especially
@code{-DUSE_READ}) in the Makefile.  Chris suggests that you use select()
if you already have it for some other reason, but that it seems to work
just fine without it.

Right now, I think mgetty won't compile with the standard C compiler (it
will with gcc), because the stuff I do in the @file{conf_*.c} source files
is a little bit too hard for it. I'll work on it.

@subsection pbmtog3
The @code{pbmtog3} program from the @file{pbmplus} distribution produces G3
data that does not adhere to the T.4 standard. The initial EOL code is
missing, and the lines are not always 1728 pixels wide.  So, some fax
machines won't accept the output at all (not printing even one line), and
others will complain.

A fix for this problem is available: I have included a patch for pbmtog3,
called @file{patches/pbmtog3.p1}, that will fix the problems. (Oh, by the
way, if you try to send a fax generated with an unpatched pbmtog3, sendfax
will complain that it doesn't like the file @dots{} I've added a small
sanity check to spare me the time browsing through the logfiles guessing
@emph{why} sendfax failed (won't work if the file has been processed by
@code{g3cat}, though!)). If you use the @code{pbmtog3} program that is
shipped with @code{mgetty}, there is @strong{no need to patch anything}.

Basically, there is no need at all to use @file{pbmplus}' @code{pbmtog3}
program any more, since @code{mgetty} includes an own copy. I just wanted
to warn you --- for example, if you install @file{pbmplus} @emph{after}
@code{mgetty}, my program will get overwritten and that will lead to
problems sending faxes, unless you have applied the patch.

Anyway, my program is lots faster @dots{}.

@node Locks, login-hang, pbmtog3, General
@subsection Lock files
Kermit et.al. cannot dial out while mgetty is running (modem responses
are eaten by mgetty)---what's wrong?

Most propably, you have not configured the @code{LOCK} and
@code{LOCKS_BINARY} defines in @file{policy.h} properly. Make sure that
the lockfiles kermit (or cu, pcomm, seyon,@dots{}) expect are in the
path specified in @code{LOCK} and set @code{LOCKS_BINARY} to 1 if they do
not write the PID of the locking process in ascii (10 bytes) to the lock
file but as a 4-byte integer instead. Mgetty and Sendfax will understand
both types of lock files, but if @code{LOCKS_BINARY} is not set properly,
other programs may not understand the lock file.

Also, make sure that both processes use the same name for the device.
(i.e., mgetty locking @file{/dev/ttyS0} and kermit locking
@file{/dev/modem} will definitely fail.)

@node login-hang, ecu, Locks, General
@subsection mgetty works, /bin/login hangs

A problem seen fairly often on directly connected serial lines
(@code{mgetty -r}), and seldomly on modem lines, is that @code{mgetty}
works flawlessly, but @code{/bin/login} just hangs instead of prompting for
the user password.

The reason for this is that many @code{login} programs reopen
@file{/dev/tty} (the controlling tty of a process) to make sure they have
full control over the password entered by the user (for example, to prevent
snooping). This will block on some systems if the DCD (carrier detect) line
coming from the modem or the other machine is low. Notably those systems
are those that have callin/callout device pairs for one serial device, e.g.
Linux, SunOS, SCO/FAS, etc.

The fix is easy: make sure that the DCD line is high. 

If you use a modem, the command to do this is usually @code{AT&C1} (but
check with your modem manual). 

If you're using a direct null-modem connection to another host, the
recommended solution is to wire DCD on your side to the DTR line on the
other side and vice versa. That way, when the remote machine ``hangs up''
(calling program exits and DTR drops), your host will get notified as
well. This is what a properly wired (!) ``null-modem cable'' does anyway.

If you don't have free lines in your serial cable (classic three-wire
approach), wire DCD to the DTR line on your own host, and make sure that
mgetty won't toggle DTR upon startup (causing a hangup signal!), e.g. by
setting @code{toggle-dtr no} in @file{mgetty.config}.

@node ecu,  , login-hang, General
@subsection ECU 3.20 or earlier on SCO collides with mgetty

ECU releases 3.20 and earlier had a severe bug in the utmp handling that
prevented dialing out on a port that mgetty uses. It has been fixed in ECU
3.27. If you run into that problem, please get a newer release.
Alternatively, you can use the patch that Uwe Fuerst provided, it can be
found in @file{patches/ecu320.p1}.

@node logfiles, ftp, General, Problems
@section Sample Log files

Both mgetty and sendfax can provide logfiles that can be very helpful for
debugging and accounting purposes. The amount that is logged is controlled
with the default set in @file{policy.h} and the command line argument
@code{-x <level>}. Higher numbers give more details.

At this place, I want to show you some typical cases, so you can compare
your log files to those given here and check what is different.

(Note: naturally all the modem initializations, and also some of the modem
responses, vary between modem brands!)

All the mgetty log files have been done with log level @code{L_MESG}, that is,
@code{-x 4}. The sendfax log file was done with @code{L_NOISE}, @code{-x 5}.

@subsection mgetty, logging into syslog

If your system has a @code{syslogd} and the @code{syslog()} C function,
mgetty can send parts of its log files to the @file{syslog} (For details,
see comments in @file{policy.h}). Not all the information from the log file
is logged here (to avoid clobbering the syslog), just errors and so-called
"audit" messages (seen in the log file as lines with "####" at the
beginning). These have a fixed format, and could easily be parsed by a
program. Let me list a few, and then comment them.

@example
Mar  3 18:36:16 greenie mgetty[673]: failed A_FAIL dev=tty4d, pid=673, caller=none, conn='', name=''
Mar  3 18:41:56 greenie mgetty[1866]: fax dev=tty4d, pid=1866, caller=none, name='', id='49 89 3243328        ', +FHNG=100, pages=1, time=00:00:29 
Mar  3 21:46:56 greenie mgetty[4807]: fax dev=tty4d, pid=4807, caller=none, name='', id='+31 20 6147110       ', +FHNG=000, pages=1, time=00:00:33 
Mar  3 20:45:59 greenie mgetty[4038]: data dev=tty4d, pid=4038, caller=none, conn='38400/V.32  9600/MNP5', name='', cmd='/bin/login', user='mbox'
Mar  3 22:41:43 greenie mgetty[6470]: data dev=tty4c, pid=6470, caller=none, conn='38400/ZyX  16800/V42b', name='', cmd='/usr/lib/uucp/uucico', user='Uartinet'
@end example

Those five lines are one failed call, two fax calls, one of them failed and
one successful, and two data calls, one of a human caller, loggin into the
BBS system, and one of a calling uucico.

It looks very confusing until you understand the system behind it. The
first fields specify date and time, originating host (greenie is my
machine) and program (mgetty). The next field specifies the type of the
connection made: @samp{fax}, @samp{data} or @samp{failed} - the latter one
usually means failure to initialize the modem or failure to connect to a
calling modem, resulting in the well-known @samp{NO CARRIER} message...

The @samp{dev} and @samp{pid} fields specify the line and process ID of the
mgetty process writing that line.

The @samp{caller} and @samp{name} fields give caller ID information - if
none is available (as it is here in Germany), or if your modem doesn't
handle it, it will list @samp{none} and @samp{''}, respectively.

For fax calls, additional informations given are the remote station ID
(@samp{id='@dots{}'}), the hangup code (@samp{+FHNG=@dots{}}, 0 means "ok"),
the number of pages and the connection time.

For data calls, the string that the modem returned after @samp{CONNECT} is
listed as @samp{conn='@dots{}'}. The string that was entered at the login
prompt is listed as @samp{user='@dots{}'}, and the program that is called
to do the login is given as @samp{cmd='@dots{}'}. Usually this will be
@code{@LOGIN@} unless you have some special system setup for fido or
uucp callers - as I have here, as you can see above.

@section How to get the mentioned software by ftp

Most of the software mentioned in this document should be available on most
major ftp sites. Nevertheless, I've got so many questions about the
software that I'll list some ftp sites here.

Furthermore, I'll list some other software that may be interesting if you
plan to use @code{mgetty+sendfax} in different environments than I do.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mgetty+sendfax}

The current release can usually be found at:

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/system/Serial/mgetty+sendfax*}

tsx-11.mit.edu:@file{/pub/linux/sources/sbin/mgetty+sendfax*}

ftp.leo.org:@file{/pub/comp/networking/communication/modem/mgetty/*}

... and on all sites that mirror SunSITE.unc.edu or tsx-11.

The current beta release is always placed at:

ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:@file{/tmp/mgetty.tar.gz} (it's a symlink to
the latest beta version on ftp.leo.org).

Use on your own risk!

@item
@code{pbmplus}

I found the pbmplus package (bitmap manipulation tools) at the following
places (most other sites mirroring X11 should also have them):

src.doc.ic.ak.uk:@file{/computing/graphics/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

wuarchive.wustl.edu:@file{/packages/X11R5/contrib-pub/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

ftp.germany.eu.net:@file{/X11/contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

The @code{pbmplus} package has been superceded by the @code{NetPBM}
package which has some more conversion tools (but also some more bugs). It
should be available on the same sites. You could also check:

wuarchive.wstl.edu:@file{/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM}

ftp.rahul.net:@file{/pub/davidsen/source}

ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de:@file{/???}

The @code{pbmtodot} program mentioned in the ``fax'' chapter can be found,
if nowhere else, in the @file{mgetty} directory on ftp.leo.org (see above).

@item
@code{FAS}

Some sites carrying the @code{fas} serial driver for SCO Unix, ISC, @dots{}:

ftp.fu-berlin.de:@file{/pub/unix/driver/fas/fas-2.11.tar.gz}

ftp.germany.eu.net:@file{/newsarchive/comp.sources.unix/volume27/fas-2.11.0/*}

src.doc.ic.ac.uk:@file{/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume27/fas-2.11.0/*}

@item
@code{GhostScript}

The GNU GhostScript postscript interpreter can be found at all sites
carrying GNU Software. The ``main'' GNU site is @emph{prep.ai.mit.edu}.

The new version 3.x isn't GNU software anymore, but uses a special
license. You can find it in @file{/pub/ghost/aladdin} on
@emph{ftp.cs.wisc.edu}, and on various other mirror sites (e.g. ftp.leo.org).

@item
@code{hp2pbm}

GhostScript is huge and slow... if you don't need it for other purposes,
you could use Chris Lewis' hp2pbm package, placed at

ftp.uunet.ca:@file{distrib/chris_lewis/hp2pbm/*}

This package contains all you need to convert ASCII or LJ PCL4 -> PBM, G3,
PS, X windows, Epson 24 pin. Coupled with mgetty's @code{g3topbm}, it's all
you need to send ASCII or HP LJ via FAX, and display/print FAXes on X, PS,
LJ, Epson, or via PBM utilities

It performs better than most of the equivalent PBMPLUS utilities.  Indeed,
if your application can generate both LJ and PS, generating LJ and
converting to G3 via @code{hp2pbm} is *much* faster than generating PS and
converting via GhostScript.

[Citing Chris: Incidentally, "g3topbm" plus my "pbm2lj" is much faster
than g3tolj.  Am not entirely sure why yet.  May have something to do
with scaling, which g3topbm and pbm2lj don't do.]

@item
@code{psroff}

ftp.uunet.ca:@file{/distrib/chris_lewis/psroff3.0pl17/*}

[Chris: It should be ...psroff/*, but they never answer when I ask them to
fix my symlink]

Contains all you need to generate PS, LJ, or ditroff from ditroff or CAT
troff or groff. Together with hp2pbm, you can generate FAXes.  Contains
quite a number of LJ fonts, font manipulation, and font scaling utilities.

With the last two tools, you can send, receive, and print FAXes using
_just_ mgetty and hp2pbm (and a Laserjet printer ;-), without needing
pbmplus or GhostScript or anything else.

@item
@code{Ifmail}

Ifmail is Eugene Crosser's FidoNet (tm) compatible Mailer + Gateway
software fuer Unix and Linux. Together with @code{mgetty}, it provides the
perfect modem solution, allowing incoming Fido calls as well as Unix-Login
and Fax. It can be found on:

tsx-11.mit.edu:@file{/pub/linux/sources/usr.bin/ifmail*}

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/system/Mail/ifmail*}

@item
@code{dialog}

Dialog is a very nice shell tool to simplify input/output functions in
shell scripts. All the programs in @file{mgetty/frontends/dialog/} rely on
it. It runs on most operating systems (except FreeBSD), as long as they
have a @code{curses} library. The source can be found on

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/utils/shell/dialog*}

@section Thanks
Many thanks to:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Peter Bechtold, peter@@fns.greenie.muc.de, for sending me dozens of faxes

attempts to send him a fax with sendfax, @dots{}

Further, for the idea to use the remote fax id as part of the filename on
received faxes.

@item
Klaus Weidner, klaus@@greenie.muc.de, for the original linux port,
testing dozens of pre-releases, writing the original texinfo
documentation, and finally for writing @code{vgetty}.

@item
Lawrence 'dreamer' Chen, lawrence@@combdyn.com, for the initial ISC port,
and for testing the package with a SupraFAX-Modem.

@item
Kay Schulz, kschulz@@gold.t-informatik.ba-stuttgart.de, for testing on ISC
--- and telling me that it's possible to ask dozens of questions without
having ever read the README file @dots{}

@item
Georg Edelmann, georg@@alpha.saar.de, for testing on Linux, and finding
some stupid bugs.

lot nailing down the problem with dial-in/dial-out)

@item
Bodo Bauer, bodo@@hal.nbg.sub.org, for porting mgetty to SVR4 (though he
did quite confuse me by insisting that the fax receiver does
not work @dots{})

@item
Christoph Adomeit, for bugging me long enough to implement XON / XOFF
flow control in fax sending / receiving, and for lending me one of
his GVC modems long enough to make faxing (well, fax sending) work with it.

@item
Christopher M. Ward, for testing on SCO with another GVC modem.

@item
Ralf Stephan, for finding a problem in sendfax whith some modems that
lower CD too soon.

@item
John C. Peterson, for correcting a similar problem in mgetty / faxrec.

@item
Chel van Gennip, for the @code{pbmscale}, @code{g3toxwd} and
@code{g3tolj} programs.

Glenn Thobe and Chris Lewis, for doing the 3B1 port(s).

@item
Chris Lewis, for doing all the @file{/etc/gettdefs} stuff, CallerID,
space limiting, making the source look really awful (K&R C support),
miscellaneous minor fixes,
and tolerating my sometimes very unfriendly reactions to his suggestions.

@item
Caz Yokoyama, for his suggestions concerning faxspool and the mail-to-fax
gateway

@item
Martin Husemann, for SVR4 testing (damn ESIX) and the NetBSD 386 port

@item
Michael A. Meiszl, mam@@mamunx.werries.de, because he asked me to (*grin*)
- and because he found + changed lots of small, nevertheless annoying
things.

@item
Brent Mosbrook from ZyXEL USA, brentm@@zyxel.com, who has been very helpful
solving some ZyXEL-specific fax questions.

@item
Simone ``Neko'' Demmel, for going to bed early, giving me time to proof
read this manual and correct all the nasty bugs.

@item
@dots{} and to all others who tested release after release.
