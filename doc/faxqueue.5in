.SH NAME
faxqueue \- sendfax fax spool queue control files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @FAX_SPOOL_OUT@/F*/JOB
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I JOB
files in the subdirectories of the outgoing fax spool directory, 
.I @FAX_SPOOL_OUT@
build up a queue of faxes to be sent by faxrunq(1). They are created by
faxspool(1), can be viewed with faxq(1), and be deleted by faxrm(1).

.SH FORMAT
The format of the JOB file is as follows:

Each line consists of a leading keyword and associated data (rest of the
line). Some are required, some others are optional. The currently
implemented keywords are:
.TP
.B phone <number>
The telephone number to send the fax to. Required.
.TP
.B user <user>
The originating user name (on the local machine). If no "mail" field is
present, this user will get the status mail about the fax. Required.
.TP
.B mail <email>
If this field is present, faxrunq(1) will send its status mail to the
address given here. If not, faxrunq(1) will use the "user" field.
Optional.
.TP
.B input <file(s)>
The file names passed to faxspool(1). Optional, used only by faxq(1).
.TP
.B pages <file(s)>
The file names, relative to the directory where the JOB file is found,
that are to be sent with sendfax(8). The files have to exist, and be
readable by the user that runs faxrunq(1). Required, except if "poll" is
used, then it's optional.
.TP
.B Status <message>
Automatically appended by faxrunq(1) after each run, tells the reader
about successful and unsuccessful tries to send this job. If more than
five "FATAL" errors are listed, the fax job is removed from the queue.
.TP
.B verbose_to <blurb>
A plain-text description of the receiver of the fax. Is returned, if
present, in the mail messages "your fax to <blurb>". Optional.
.TP
.B time <hhmm>
If present, 
.I 
faxrunq
won't send this job before the given time. The format must be exactly
"hhmm", in 24-hr-format, otherwise faxrunq won't understan it. Optional.
.TP
.B poll
Flag token.  If present, faxrunq will try to poll the given phone
number for documents (see "sendfax -p").
.TP
.B normal_res
Flag token.  If present, faxrunq will transmit all pages using normal
resolution (see "sendfax -n").
.TP
.B subject <arbitrary string>
This is a pure comment field, used only for informational purposes.
.I
faxrunq
will return it in the sucess/failure mail. If you use 
.I
faxspool -s <subj>,
it will put this string on the cover page and in the JOB file.


.SH PROCESSING

While a given JOB file is processed by faxrunq(1), it's locked against
sending it multiple times by temporarily renaming it to
.I JOB.locked,
thus it may happen that a faxq(1) command doesn't show this job.

When a job is successfully sent, it's not deleted but the JOB file is
renamed to
.I JOB.done.
Because of this, you can still see old jobs with "faxq -o". You should
regularly clean up the outgoing fax directory, removing old faxes. If you
don't want this behaviour, look into the faxrunq shell script, and remove
the comment signs before the code to delete the job files.

When a job cannot be sent after several tries (excluding normal
difficulties like the called number being busy or the modem being in
use), the JOB file is renamed to
.I JOB.suspended.
To re-queue this job, rename the JOB file back and remove all the
"Status" lines in it.
