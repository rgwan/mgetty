[ This is very Linux specific. However, the basics should work
  with usual pppd configurations on other UNIX systems too
]

People like to have users dial in with PPP instead of normal login. This
can be safer and also easier to use / more powerful. Using pppd with
mgetty is twoafold: first, you need to make so that pppd is launched one
way or another. There are two ways:

   1. make so that mgetty auto-detects a PPP frame before
      (technically: after) even sending the login: prompt.
      This means thats the people will not have to login first
      (in clear: no ogin:/sword: chat scripts needed).

   2. make so that the user first logs in with a special user, and
      then either pppd is the user's shell, or the user launches
      pppd from there manually.

Although technically possible, method 2 is discouraged and will not be
described here. Method 1 is the suggested method and will be discussed
here.

To use method 1, the following are mgetty pre-requisites:

   - mgetty must have been compiled with -DAUTO_PPP (see mgetty's
     documentation and other FAQ entries)
   - The /AutoPPP/ demonstration line in login.config must be uncommented,
     and all arguments checked, such as e.g. path to pppd executable, etc.

Other pre-requisites that will not be detailed here are of course PPP
support in your OS/kernel, a working pppd, etc.

What do you put on the pppd command line in login.config ?  It really
depends how you want to handle your incoming PPP connections. Assuming
you assigned the IP address 192.168.2.1 to your PPP server, and that you
want some debugging in the system log (on Linux: /var/log/messages),
you would use something like this:

   /AutoPPP/ -    a_ppp   /usr/sbin/pppd crtscts modem -detach debug 192.168.2.1:

Of course, this doesn't authentify the user, doesn't support connecting to
other computers than the PPP server, and so on.

For authentification, you must add the auth keyword on the pppd command 
line(*). Then, you have the following choices:

[
(*) a ``better'' approach can be to put all those options in /etc/ppp/options.
    You could create an option file per port your are activating, e.g.
    if you want to statically set up static addresses per tty, and not
    per user.
    Example:
       /etc/ppp/options.ttyS0
          pppserver:pppserver-ttyS0   # converted by DNS to IP addresses
          asyncmap 0
          proxyarp
          modem
          auth
          crtscts
          require-chap
          ktune
          name ppp-server
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          ms-dns 192.168.15.1
          ms-dns 192.168.15.2

    AT LEAST: you should not have some options in /etc/ppp/options, and
              some more on the command line. Keep everything in the
              same place.

   - you can use a password database in /etc/ppp/, be it chap-secrets or
     pap-secrets (chap-secrets contains cleartext passwords, but password
     hashes only are transmitted in clear; pap-secrets works mostly like
     UNIX authentification: the crypted password is stored and the
     unencrypted is transmitted).

        auth -pap +chap
        auth +pap -chap

   - you can use PAP, but with the /etc/passwd database (or possibly even
     the PAM authentifications). This is the ``login'' option.

        auth +pap -chap login

Assuming you use PAP, you need to modify the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, unless
you used the login option: in that case, valid users in /etc/passwd make
valid users for PPP. Possibly the IP address is then taken from
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets, still (but I am not sure of it --- I don't use the
login option, I use CHAP anyway).

Note that you can force an IP address for the client either by listing it
on the right of the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets or /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, or in
the command line (192.168.2.1:192.168.2.2 forces 192.168.2.2 as client).

Of course, forcing for both only works either if you have only one
PPP dialup line, or if you assigned specific configurations/addresses
per tty (see the bracketed comments above about /etc/ppp/options.ttySx).

Note that if the client not only authentifies itself to the server but
also requests authentification from the PPP server, things get more
complicated. In most setups you don't need this, so do not use auth
keyword on the pppd client.

Some users report that some distributions ship pppd without the
execute bit set. This will even prevent root from executing it.

   chmod 555 `which pppd`
   chown root.root `which pppd`

You don't need the setuid or setgid or any other things when
running from mgetty login.config.

Other users reported that pppd version 2.3.7 has a bug which causes
not passing of utmp parameters with /AutoPPP/, ``hence you will never
get a login using /etc/passwd''. Versions 2.3.8 and 2.3.9 seem
unaffected.  Well, I don't really understand why utmp should be
related to that problem.

To allow the newly connected user to connect to any computer of the local
network where the PPP server is located, you need this:

   - The IP addresses must be in the same routing zone as the ones from
     the local network. This means: if the Ethernet network uses
     192.168.2.X (or 192.168.2.0/24 as people like to write it), your
     PPP server and the PPP users must get assigned addresses in this
     zone too.

   - You must add the ``proxyarp'' option to the AutoPPP line above. This
     tells pppd that it should advertises the user PPP connected address
     on the Ethernet.

   - Your kernel must have IP forwarding on, and in some cases the option
     ktune should also be given to pppd so it can set it for that
     interface (assuming you don't forward by default).

Alternatively, you can set up your PPP server with completely different
addresses, but then you need to either have all computers on the Ethernet
to have default route on the PPP server or to have specific routing.

That will not make proprietary non-routable protocols such as NetBEUI
work: typically the ``Network neighbourhood'' of MS-WINDOWS'* will fail.
For that to work, you need to have a WINS server on the network (be it on
the Ethernet or the PPP server itself), and reference it in hard in the
dial-in clients (it works better that way it seems).

You may also want to configure your /etc/ppp/options file, e.g. for
supporting extensions such as the Microsoft DNS or WINS handshake.

If after all this, you still have a problem with pppd and mgetty, post to
the mailing-list, but make sure that you:

   - show clearly if mgetty does launch pppd or not (ie if it's a mgetty
     or pppd problem)
   - show an excerpt from the system pppd log.
