1) faxq: show last faxrunq(d) run ($FAX_SPOOL_OUT/.last_run)

2) nph-vf-gif: set umask 022 - otherwise, temp files will be world-writeable

3) nph-vf-gif: build cleanup jobs that will remove all fax files that
   haven't been looked at (atime) since over a week

4) nph-vf-gif: check whether $FAX_SPOOL_IN/* is *readable*, otherwise 
   print error message [instead of just creating 0-byte-length files]

5) nph-vf-gif: for all "permission denied" errors, show the user ID that
   the script is run as - this makes fixing the problems a lot easier


6) faxhist/<new>: build "search" function to search acct.log for certain
   strings, like a telephone number, or an "-A <xyz>" accounting handle.

6a) make maximum number of "hits" configurable (otherwise some customers
   with a high fax volume will kill your browser)

6b) if maximum is hit, make "next" button


7) nph-vf-gif: make nice buttons for turn left/turn next, go to
   next/pref page (-> Neko, GIMP)
