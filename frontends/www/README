This is a collection of tools to maintain mgetty using a WWW interface
(CGI binaries and a couple of static pages).

Right now, it's not yet "plug and play", and it's only known to work
with Apache and Roxen web servers (CERN has some weird problems).

Please direct all questions concerning the WWW gui to Simone Demmel
(neko@greenie.muc.de) or to the mgetty mailing list (mgetty@muc.de).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You need on your system:

* installed mgetty+sendfax package
* g32pbm (use this from gert, it is much faster than this one from the
  pbm-tool-kit!)
* pbmtogif (pbm-tools)
* pnmscale (pbm-tools)
* ppmquant (pbm-tools)
* a running httpd
* perl (testet with perl5.001, should run with other versions as well)
* a web browser with forms (on your client side!)

Installation:

See INSTALL.README and readme.txt in the appropriate package!

CGI-Bin:
Be sure your webserver can execute cgi-bins in users directories.
	if not: you will have to add in every link (generated or not, your
	cgi-bin-path /cgi-bin...)

I'll add a special case for this, if I see that it will be needed.
	      

You can do:

* writing and sending short messages
  - add files
  - choose a cover-page
  - add a short message

* viewing faxes via WWW


If you have questions: ask Simone Demmel, neko@greenie.muc.de
