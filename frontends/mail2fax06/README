This is a newly written mail to fax gateway that can handle MIME attachments
(like "tiff images" or "pdf documents").  

Actually, it can handle all file types that faxspool will handle.


How to use it?

- mail2fax.pl expects a fax number, usually in the form "12345@fax.do.main"
  on the command line, and a well-formatted e-mail on stdin

- the e-mail address of the sender is passed as "-f <address>" on the
  command line

- depending on your e-mail transport, you need to make sure that 
  mail2fax.pl is called with the proper arguments for e-mails sent to 
  your fax pseudo-domain.


  1. SENDMAIL

   - adapt sendmail.cf (or sendmail.mc) to include a "fax" mailer - the
     hylafax "mailer/fax.mc" mailer prototype can be used, you just need
     to adapt the command line.  The net result in sendmail.cf should
     look like this:

      Mfax,     P=/usr/local/lib/mgetty+sendfax/mail2fax.pl,
                F=DFMhuS, S=14, R=24, U=fax:dialer,
                D=/var/spool/fax, M=500000, T=X-Phone/X-FAX/X-Unix,
                A=mail2fax -h $h -f $f $u

   - in your "mailertable" file, route your fax pseudo domain to this
     mailer transport:

      fax.do.main     fax:faxrelay

     (the "fax:" part is the key, it means "call the program defined in Mfax, 
      and pass the e-mail-address as "$u", and the from address as "$f".  
      The "faxrelay" part is just an arbitrary string, passed as "$h", but
      it's not currently used)


  2. QMAIL

   - there are multiple possible approaches - this is just one variant I've
     seen used at a qmail site.

   - use "control/virtualdomains" to tell your mail server that "fax.do.main" 
     is something to be handled locally on your system:

        fax.do.main:fax.do.main

     (specifically: all mail to <number>@fax.do.main is mapped to the 
     pseudo-user "fax.do.main-<number>@fax.do.main" and delivered locally,
     see "man qmail-send")

   - use "users/assign" to map your fax.do.main pseudo user to a local user
     directory:

        +fax.do.main-:fax.do.main:411:411:/home/mail2fax/qmail/:-::

   - in the /home/mail2fax/qmail/ directory, create a .qmail-default file
     that pipes to fax2mail:

        |/usr/local/lib/mgetty+sendfax/mail2fax.pl -f $SENDER $EXT

     ($EXT contains the original fax number)


  3. Postfix
   <example config to be inserted>
     

- currently, no authorization is done by mail2fax.pl - so you should 
  use your MTA rules to restrict who is permitted to send mails to your
  fax pseudo domain, and thus who may use the fax setup.

- logging goes to /var/log/mgetty/mail2fax.log (by default) - make sure
  the user ID that your MTA uses to call mail2fax.pl is permitted to write
  to that directory, otherwise fax-mail will bounce.

- mail2fax.pl needs a working directory, by default /var/spool/fax/tmp/,
  again, writeable by the user ID picked by your MTA.  If the directory isn't
  there, or not writeable, fax-mail will bounce.
